      Chapter I
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     When Johnnie comes marching home again,
          Hurrah!  Hurrah!
     We'll give him a hearty welcome then,
          Hurrah!  Hurrah!
     The men with the cheers, the boys with shouts,
          The ladies they will all turn out,
     And we'll all feel gay, when Johnnie comes marching home again!
</pre>
    <p>
      The old man and the little boy, his grandson, sat together in the shade of
      the big walnut tree in the front yard, watching the &ldquo;Decoration Day
      Parade,&rdquo; as it passed up the long street; and when the last of the
      veterans was out of sight the grandfather murmured the words of the tune
      that came drifting back from the now distant band at the head of the
      procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we'll all feel gay when Johnnie comes marching home again,&rdquo; he
      finished, with a musing chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you, Grandpa?&rdquo; the boy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you all feel gay when the army got home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn't get home all at once, precisely,&rdquo; the grandfather explained.
      &ldquo;When the war was over I suppose we felt relieved, more than anything
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't feel so gay when the war <i>was</i>, though, I guess!&rdquo; the boy
      ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you scared, Grandpa? Were you ever scared the Rebels would win?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We weren't ever afraid of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not any at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not any at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, weren't you ever scared yourself, Grandpa? I mean when you were in
      a battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; <i>then</i> I was.&rdquo; The old man laughed. &ldquo;Scared plenty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why,&rdquo; the boy said promptly. &ldquo;I wouldn't be scared in a
      battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Course not! Grandpa, why don't you march in the Decoration Day Parade?
      Wouldn't they let you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not able to march any more. Too short of breath and too shaky in the
      legs and too blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't care,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;I'd be in the parade anyway, if I was
      you. They had some sittin' in carriages, 'way at the tail end; but I
      wouldn't like that. If I'd been in your place, Grandpa, and they'd let me
      be in that parade, I'd been right up by the band. Look, Grandpa! Watch me,
      Grandpa! This is the way I'd be, Grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the garden bench where they sat, and gave a complex imitation
      of what had most appealed to him as the grandeurs of the procession, his
      prancing legs simulating those of the horse of the grand marshal, while
      his upper parts rendered the drums and bugles of the band, as well as the
      officers and privates of the militia company which had been a feature of
      the parade. The only thing he left out was the detachment of veterans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Putty-boom! Putty-boom! Putty-boom-boom-boom!&rdquo; he vociferated, as the
      drums&mdash;and then as the bugles: &ldquo;Ta, ta, ra, tara!&rdquo; He addressed his
      restive legs: &ldquo;<i>Whoa</i>, there, you Whitey! Gee! Haw! Git up!&rdquo; Then,
      waving an imaginary sword: &ldquo;Col-lumn right! Farwud <i>March!</i> Halt!
      Carry <i>harms!</i>&rdquo; He &ldquo;carried arms.&rdquo; &ldquo;Show-dler <i>harms!</i>&rdquo; He
      &ldquo;shouldered arms,&rdquo; and returned to his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'd be me, Grandpa. That's the way I'd do.&rdquo; And as the grandfather
      nodded, seeming to agree, a thought recently dismissed returned to the
      mind of the composite procession and he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>why</i> weren't you ever afraid the Rebels would whip the
      Unions, Grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we knew they couldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so.&rdquo; The little boy laughed disdainfully, thinking his question
      satisfactorily answered. &ldquo;I guess those ole Rebels couldn't whipped a
      flea! They didn't know how to fight any at all, did they, Grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, they did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; The boy was astounded. &ldquo;Weren't they all just reg'lar ole cowards,
      Grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the grandfather. &ldquo;They were pretty fine soldiers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were? Well, they ran away whenever you began shootin' at 'em, didn't
      they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes they did, but most times they didn't. Sometimes they fought
      like wildcats&mdash;and sometimes we were the ones that ran away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep from getting killed, or maybe to keep from getting captured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Rebels were bad men, weren't they, Grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy's forehead, customarily vacant, showed some little vertical
      shadows, produced by a struggle to think. &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;&rdquo; he began,
      slowly. &ldquo;Listen, Grandpa, listen here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! Well, you said&mdash;you said you never got scared the ole Rebels
      were goin' to win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did win pretty often,&rdquo; said the grandfather. &ldquo;They won a good many
      battles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, you said you never got scared they'd win the war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we were never afraid of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but if they were good men and fought like wildcats, Grandpa, and
      kep' winning battles and everything, how could that be? How could you <i>help</i>
      bein' scared they'd win the war?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The grandfather's feeble eyes twinkled brightly. &ldquo;Why, we <i>knew</i> they
      couldn't, Ramsey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, the little vertical shadows on Ramsey's forehead became more
      pronounced, for he had succeeded in thinking. &ldquo;Well, <i>they</i> didn't
      know they couldn't, did they?&rdquo; he argued. &ldquo;They thought they were goin' to
      win, didn't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess they did. Up till toward the last, I suppose they probably
      did. But you see they were wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;&rdquo; Ramsey struggled. &ldquo;Listen! Listen here, Grandpa! Well,
      anyway, if they never got scared <i>we'd</i> win, and nobody got scared <i>they'd</i>
      win&mdash;well, I don't see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't see what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ramsey found himself unable to continue his concentration; he slumped
      down upon the small of his back, and his brow relaxed to its more
      comfortable placidity, while his eyes wandered with a new butterfly
      fluttering over the irises that bordered the iron picket fence at the
      south side of the yard. &ldquo;Oh, nothin' much,&rdquo; he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; And his grandfather laughed again. &ldquo;You mean: If the Rebels felt
      just as sure of winning the war as we did, and kept winning battles why
      shouldn't we ever have had any doubts that we were going to win? That's
      it, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so, Grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it was mostly because we were certain that we were right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;The Rebels knew they were on the side of the
      Devil.&rdquo; But at this, the grandfather's laugh was louder than it had been
      before, and Ramsey looked hurt. &ldquo;Well, you can laugh if you want to!&rdquo; he
      objected in an aggrieved voice. &ldquo;Anyway, the Sunday-school sup'intendent
      told us when people knew they were on the Devil's side they always&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say, I dare say,&rdquo; the old man interrupted, a little impatiently.
      &ldquo;But in this world mighty few people think they're on the Devil's side,
      Ramsey. There was a Frenchman once, in olden times; he said people were
      crazy because, though they couldn't even make worms, they believed they
      could make gods. And so whenever countries or parts of a country get into
      a war, each side makes a god and a devil, and says: 'God's on our side and
      the Devil's on the other.' The South thought the Devil was on our side,
      you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that kind o' mixes it all up more'n ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it seems so; but Abraham Lincoln wasn't mixed up about it. When some
      people told him that God was on our side, he said the important thing was
      to find out if we were on God's side. That was the whole question, you
      see; because either side could make up a god, the kind of a god they liked
      and wanted; and then they'd believe in him, too, and fight for him&mdash;but
      if he was only a made-up god they'd lose. President Lincoln didn't want to
      have a made-up god on his side; he wanted to find God Himself and find out
      what he wanted, and then do it. And that's what Lincoln did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't understand much of all <i>that</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Then suppose you look at it this way: The South was fighting for what
      it believed to be its rights, but we weren't fighting for our rights; we
      were fighting for the right. The South was fighting for what it believed
      to be its right to split the Union and be a country by itself; but we were
      fighting for 'Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable.' It
      wasn't only the Union we fought for; it was Freedom. The South wanted
      freedom to leave the Union; but the reason the South wanted that freedom
      to separate from us was because <i>we</i> wanted the Freedom of Man. <i>There's</i>
      the reason we had the certain knowledge that we were going to win the war.
      How plain and simple it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey didn't think so. He had begun to feel bored by the conversation,
      and to undergo the oppression he usually suffered in school; yet he took a
      little interest in the inexplicable increase of fervour with which his
      grandfather spoke, and in a shoot of sunshine which somehow got through
      the foliage of the walnut tree and made a bedazzlement of glinting fine
      lines in one spot, about the size of a saucer, upon the old man's head of
      thick white hair. Half closing his eyes, drowsily, Ramsey played that this
      sunshine spot was a white bird's-nest and, and he had a momentary half
      dream of a glittering little bird that dwelt there and wore a blue soldier
      cap on its head. The earnest old voice of the veteran was only a sound in
      the boy's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's simple and plain enough now, though then we didn't often think
      of it in exactly this way, but just went on fighting and never doubted. We
      knew the struggle and suffering of our fathers and grandfathers to make a
      great country here for Freedom, and we knew that all this wasn't just the
      whim of a foolish god, willing to waste such great things&mdash;we knew
      that such a country couldn't have been building up just to be wasted. But,
      more than that, we knew that armies fighting for the Freedom of Man <i>had</i>
      to win, in the long run, over armies that fought for what they considered
      their rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't set out to free the slaves, so far as we knew. Yet our being
      against slavery was what made the war, and we had the consciousness that
      we were on the side of God's plan, because His plan is clearly the Freedom
      of Man. Long ago we began to see the hints of His plan&mdash;a little like
      the way you can see what's coming in August from what happens in April,
      but man has to win his freedom from himself&mdash;men in the light have to
      fight against men in the dark of their own shadow. That light is the
      answer; we had the light that made us never doubt. Ours was the true
      light, and so we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boom&mdash;&rdquo; The veterans had begun to fire their cannon on the crest of
      the low hill, out at the cemetery; and from a little way down the street
      came the rat-a-tat of a toy drum and sounds of a fife played execrably. A
      file of children in cocked hats made of newspapers came marching
      importantly up the sidewalk under the maple shade trees; and in advance,
      upon a velocipede, rode a tin-sworded personage, shrieking incessant
      commands but not concerning himself with whether or not any military
      obedience was thereby obtained. Here was a revivifying effect upon young
      Ramsey; his sluggard eyelids opened electrically; he leaped to his feet
      and, abandoning his grandfather without preface or apology, sped across
      the lawn and out of the gate, charging headlong upon the commander of the
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get off that 'locipede, Wesley Bender!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;You gimme that
      sword! What rights you got to go bein' captain o' my army, I'd like to
      know! Who got up this army, in the first place, I'd like to know! I did,
      myself yesterd'y afternoon, and you get back in line or I won't let you
      b'long to it at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pretender succumbed; he instantly dismounted, being out-shouted and
      overawed. On foot he took his place in the ranks, while Ramsey became
      sternly vociferous. &ldquo;In-tention, company! Farwud <i>march</i>! Col-lumn <i>right</i>!
      Right-showdler <i>harms</i>! Halt! Far-wud <i>march</i>. Carry harms&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Army went trudging away under the continuous but unheeded fire of
      orders, and presently disappeared round a corner, leaving the veteran
      chuckling feebly under his walnut tree and alone with the empty street.
      All trace of what he had said seemed to have been wiped from the
      grandson's mind; but memory has curious ways. Ramsey had understood not a
      fifth nor a tenth of his grandfather's talk, and already he had
      &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; all of it&mdash;yet not only were there many, many times in
      the boy's later life when, without ascertainable cause, he would remember
      the sunlight falling upon the old man's white head, to make that semblance
      of a glittering bird's-nest there, but with the picture came recollections
      of words and sentences spoken by the grandfather, though the listener,
      half-drowsily, had heard but the sound of an old, earnest voice&mdash;and
      even the veteran's meaning finally took on a greater definiteness till it
      became, in the grandson's thoughts, something clear and bright and
      beautiful that he knew without being just sure where or how he had learned
      it.

    <h2>
      Chapter II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ramsey Milholland sat miserably in school, his conscious being consisting
      principally of a dull hate. Torpor was a little dispersed during a
      fifteen-minute interval of &ldquo;Music,&rdquo; when he and all the other pupils in
      the large room of the &ldquo;Five B. Grade&rdquo; sang repeated fractions of what they
      enunciated as &ldquo;The Star Span-guh-hulled Banner&rdquo;; but afterward he relapsed
      into the low spirits and animosity natural to anybody during enforced
      confinement under instruction. No alleviation was accomplished by an
      invader's temporary usurpation of the teacher's platform, a brisk and
      unsympathetically cheerful young woman mounting thereon to &ldquo;teach German.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long time mathematics and German had been about equally repulsive to
      Ramsey, who found himself daily in the compulsory presence of both; but he
      was gradually coming to regard German with the greater horror, because,
      after months of patient mental resistance, he at last began to comprehend
      that the German language has sixteen special and particular ways of using
      the German article corresponding to that flexible bit of a word so easily
      managed English&mdash;<i>the</i>. What in the world was the use of having
      sixteen ways of doing a thing that could just as well be done in one? If
      the Germans had contented themselves with insisting upon sixteen useless
      variations for infrequent words, such as <i>hippopotamus</i>, for
      instance, Ramsey might have thought the affair unreasonable but not
      necessarily vicious&mdash;it would be easy enough to avoid talking about a
      hippopotamus if he ever had to go to Germany. But the fact that the
      Germans picked out <i>a</i> and <i>the</i> and many other little words in
      use all the time, and gave every one of them sixteen forms, and expected
      Ramsey Milholland to learn this dizzying uselessness down to the last
      crotchety detail, with &ldquo;When to employ Which&rdquo; as a nausea to prepare for
      the final convulsion when one <i>didn't</i> use Which, because it was an
      &ldquo;Exception&rdquo;&mdash;there was a fashion of making easy matters hard that was
      merely hellish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The teacher was strict but enthusiastic; she told the children, over and
      over, that German was a beautiful language, and her face always had a glow
      when she said this. At such times the children looked patient; they
      supposed it must be so, because she was an adult and their teacher; and
      they believed her with the same manner of believing which those of them
      who went to Sunday-school used there when the Sunday-school teachers were
      pushed into explanations of various matters set forth in the Old
      Testament, or gave reckless descriptions of heaven. That is to say, the
      children did not challenge or deny; already they had been driven into
      habits of resignation and were passing out of the age when childhood is
      able to reject adult nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, to Ramsey Milholland, the German language seemed to be a collection
      of perverse inventions for undeserved torment; it was full of revolting
      surprises in the way of genders; vocally it often necessitated the
      employment of noises suggestive of an incompletely mastered knowledge of
      etiquette; and far inside him there was something faintly but constantly
      antagonistic to it&mdash;yet, when the teacher declared that German was
      incomparably the most beautiful language in the world, one of the many
      facets of his mind submissively absorbed the statement as light to be
      passed inward; it was part of the lesson to be learned. He did not know
      whether the English language was beautiful or not; he never thought about
      that, and no one ever said anything to him about it. Moreover, though his
      deeper inward hated &ldquo;German,&rdquo; he liked his German teacher, and it was
      pleasant to look at her when that glow came upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, too, there were moments of relaxation in her class, when she
      would stop the lesson and tell the children about Germany: what a
      beautiful, good country it was, so trim and orderly, with such pleasant
      customs, and all the people sensible and energetic and healthy. There was
      &ldquo;Music&rdquo; again in the German class, which was another alleviation; though
      it was the same old &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner&rdquo; over again. Ramsey was tired of
      the song and tired of &ldquo;My Country 'Tis of Thee&rdquo;; they were bores, but it
      was amusing to sing them in German. In German they sounded &ldquo;sort o'
      funny,&rdquo; so he didn't mind this bit of the day's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later there arrived his supreme trial of this particular
      morning. Arithmetic then being the order of business before the house, he
      was sent alone to the blackboard, supposedly to make lucid the proper
      reply to a fatal conundrum in decimals, and under the glare and focus of
      the whole room he breathed heavily and itched everywhere; his brain at
      once became sheer hash. He consumed as much time as possible in getting
      the terms of the problem stated in chalk; then, affecting to be critical
      of his own handiwork, erased what he had done and carefully wrote it
      again. After that, he erased half of it, slowly retraced the figures, and
      stepped back as if to see whether perspective improved their appearance.
      Again he lifted the eraser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramsey Milholland!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down that eraser!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm. I just thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sharply bidden to get forward with his task, he explained in a feeble
      voice that he had first to tie a shoe string and stooped to do so, but was
      not permitted. Miss Ridgely tried to stimulate him with hints and
      suggestion; found him, so far as decimals went, mere protoplasm, and,
      wondering how so helpless a thing could live, summoned to the board little
      Dora Yocum, the star of the class, whereupon Ramsey moved toward his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand still, Ramsey! You stay right where you are and try to learn
      something from the way Dora does it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The class giggled, and Ramsey stood, but learned nothing. His
      conspicuousness was unendurable, because all of his schoolmates naturally
      found more entertainment in watching him than in following the performance
      of the capable Dora. He put his hands in and out of his pockets; was
      bidden to hold them still, also not to shuffle his feet; and when in a
      false assumption of ease he would have scratched his head Miss Ridgely's
      severity increased, so that he was compelled to give over the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instructed to watch every figure chalked up by the mathematical wonder,
      his eyes, grown sodden, were unable to remove themselves from the part in
      her hair at the back of her head, where two little braids began their
      separate careers to end in a couple of blue-and-red checked bits of
      ribbon, one upon each of her thin shoulder blades. He was conscious that
      the part in Dora's shining brown hair was odious, but he was unconscious
      of anything arithmetical. His sensations clogged his intellect; he
      suffered from unsought notoriety, and hated Dora Yocum; most of all he
      hated her busy little shoulder blades.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to be &ldquo;kept in&rdquo; after school; and when he was allowed to go home he
      averted his eyes as he went by the house where Dora lived. She was out in
      the yard, eating a doughnut, and he knew it; but he had passed the age
      when it is just as permissible to throw a rock at a girl as at a boy; and
      stifling his normal inclinations, he walked sturdily on, though he
      indulged himself so far as to engage in a murmured conversation with one
      of the familiar spirits dwelling somewhere within him. &ldquo;Pfa!&rdquo; said Ramsey
      to himself&mdash;or himself to Ramsey, since it is difficult to say which
      was which. &ldquo;Pfa! Thinks she's smart, don't she?&rdquo;... &ldquo;Well, I guess she
      does, but she ain't!&rdquo; ... &ldquo;I hate her, don't you?&rdquo;... &ldquo;You bet your life I
      hate her!&rdquo;... &ldquo;Teacher's Pet, that's what <i>I</i> call her!&rdquo;... &ldquo;Well,
      that's what <i>I</i> call her, too, don't I?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> do; that's
      all she is, anyway&mdash;dirty ole Teacher's Pet!&rdquo;

      Chapter III
    </h2>
    <p>
      He had not forgiven her four years later when he entered high school in
      her company, for somehow Ramsey managed to shovel his way through
      examinations and stayed with the class. By this time he had a long
      accumulation of reasons for hating her: Dora's persistent and increasing
      competency was not short of flamboyant, and teachers naturally got the
      habit of flinging their quickest pupil in the face of their slowest and
      &ldquo;dumbest.&rdquo; Nevertheless, Ramsey was unable to deny that she had become
      less awful lookin' than she used to be. At least, he was honest enough to
      make a partial retraction when his friend and classmate, Fred Mitchell,
      insisted that an amelioration of Dora's appearance could be actually
      proven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll take it back. I don't claim she's every last bit as awful
      lookin' as she always has been,&rdquo; said Ramsey, toward the conclusion of the
      argument. &ldquo;I'll say this for her, she's awful lookin', but she may not be
      as awful lookin' as she was. She don't come to school with the edge of
      some of her underclo'es showin' below her dress any more, about every
      other day, and her eyewinkers have got to stickin' out some, and she may
      not be so abbasa<i>loot</i>ly skinny, but she'll haf to wait a mighty long
      while before <i>I</i> want to look at her without gettin' sick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The implication that Miss Yocum cared to have Ramsey look at her, either
      with or without gettin' sick, was mere rhetoric, and recognized as such by
      the producer of it; she had never given the slightest evidence of any
      desire that his gaze be bent upon her. What truth lay underneath his
      flourish rested upon the fact that he could not look at her without some
      symptoms of the sort he had tersely sketched to his friend; and yet, so
      pungent is the fascination of self-inflicted misery, he did look at her,
      during periods of study, often for three or four minutes at a stretch. His
      expression at such times indeed resembled that of one who has dined
      unwisely; but Dora Yocum was always too eagerly busy to notice it. He was
      almost never in her eye, but she was continually in his; moreover, as the
      banner pupil she was with hourly frequency an exhibit before the whole
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey found her worst of all when her turn came in &ldquo;Declamation,&rdquo; on
      Friday afternoons. When she ascended the platform, bobbed a little
      preliminary bow and began, &ldquo;Listen, my children, and you shall hear,&rdquo;
       Ramsey included Paul Revere and the Old North Church and the whole
      Revolutionary War in his antipathy, since they somehow appeared to be the
      property of the Teacher's Pet. For Dora held this post in &ldquo;Declamation&rdquo; as
      well as in everything else; here, as elsewhere, the hateful child's
      prowess surpassed that of all others; and the teacher always entrusted her
      with the rendition of the &ldquo;patriotic selections&rdquo;: Dora seemed to take fire
      herself when she declared:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;The fate of a nation was riding that night;
     And the spark struck out by that steed in his flight,
     Kindled the land into flame with its heat.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Ramsey himself was in the same section of declaimers, and performed next&mdash;a
      ghastly contrast. He gave a &ldquo;selection from Shakespeare,&rdquo; assigned by the
      teacher; and he began this continuous misfortune by stumbling violently as
      he ascended the platform, which stimulated a general giggle already in
      being at the mere calling of his name. All of the class were bright with
      happy anticipation, for the miserable Ramsey seldom failed their hopes,
      particularly in &ldquo;Declamation.&rdquo; He faced them, his complexion wan, his
      expression both baleful and horrified; and he began in a loud, hurried
      voice, from which every hint of intelligence was excluded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most pottent, grave, and rev&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The teacher tapped sharply on her desk, and stopped him. &ldquo;You've forgotten
      to bow,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And don't say 'pottent.' The word is 'potent'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey flopped his head at the rear wall of the room, and began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most pottent potent gray and revenerd signers my very nobe and approve
      good masters that I have tan away this sole man's dutter it is mose true
      true I have marry dur the very headman frun tuv my fending hath this
      extent no more rude am I in speech&mdash;in speech&mdash;rude am I in
      speech&mdash;in speech&mdash;in speech&mdash;in speech&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had stalled. Perhaps the fatal truth of that phrase, and some sense of
      its applicability to the occasion had interfered with the mechanism which
      he had set in operation to get rid of the &ldquo;recitation&rdquo; for him. At all
      events, the machine had to run off its job all at once, or it wouldn't run
      at all. Stopped, it stayed stopped, and backing off granted no new
      impetus, though he tried, again and again. &ldquo;Hath this extent no more rude
      am I in speech&mdash;&rdquo; He gulped audibly. &ldquo;Rude rude rude am I&mdash;rude
      am I in speech&mdash;in speech&mdash;in speech. Rude am I in speech&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the irritated teacher said, as Ramsey's failing voice continued
      huskily to insist upon this point. &ldquo;I think you are!&rdquo; And her nerves were
      a little soothed by the shout of laughter from the school&mdash;it was
      never difficult for teachers to be witty. &ldquo;Go sit down, Ramsey, and do it
      after school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His ears roaring, the unfortunate went to his seat, and, among all the
      hilarious faces, one stood out&mdash;Dora Yocum's. Her laughter was
      precocious; it was that of a confirmed superior, insufferably adult&mdash;she
      was laughing at him as a grown person laughs at a child. Conspicuously and
      unmistakably, there was something indulgent in her amusement. He choked.
      Here was a little squirt of a high-school girl who would trot up to George
      Washington himself and show off around him, given the opportunity; and
      George Washington would probably pat her on the head, or give her a medal&mdash;or
      something. Well, let him! Ramsey didn't care. He didn't care for George
      Washington, or Paul Revere, or Shakespeare, or any of 'em. They could all
      go to the dickens with Dora Yocum. They were all a lot of smarties anyway
      and he hated the whole stew of 'em!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one, however, whom he somehow couldn't manage to hate, even
      though this one officially seemed to be as intimately associated with Dora
      Yocum and superiority as the others were. Ramsey couldn't hate Abraham
      Lincoln, even when Dora was chosen to deliver the &ldquo;Gettysburg Address&rdquo; on
      the twelfth of February. Vaguely, yet reassuringly, Ramsey felt that
      Lincoln had resisted adoption by the intellectuals. Lincoln had said
      &ldquo;Government of the people, by the people, for the people,&rdquo; and that didn't
      mean government by the teacher and the Teacher's Pet and Paul Revere and
      Shakespeare and suchlike; it meant government by everybody, and therefore
      Ramsey had as much to do with it as anybody else had. This was friendly;
      and he believed that if Abraham Lincoln could have walked into the
      schoolroom, Lincoln would have been as friendly with him as with Dora and
      the teacher herself. Beyond a doubt, Dora and the teacher <i>thought</i>
      Lincoln belonged to them and their crowd of exclusives; they seemed to
      think they owned the whole United States; but Ramsey was sure they were
      mistaken about Abraham Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that it was just like this little Yocum snippet to assume such a
      thing, and it made him sicker than ever to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, one day, he noticed that her eye-winkers were stickin' out farther
      and farther.

    <p>
      His discovery irritated him the more. Next thing, this ole Teacher's Pet
      would do she'd get to thinkin' she was pretty! If <i>that</i> happened,
      well, nobody <i>could</i> stand her! The long lashes made her eyes
      shadowy, and it was a fact that her shoulder blades ceased to insist upon
      notoriety; you couldn't tell where they were at all, any more. Her back
      seemed to be just a regular back, not made up of a lot of implements like
      shoulder blades and things.
    </p>
    <p>
      A contemptible thing happened. Wesley Bender was well known to be the most
      untidy boy in the class and had never shown any remorse for his reputation
      or made the slightest effort either to improve or to dispute it. He was
      content: it failed to lower his standing with his fellows or to impress
      them unfavourably. In fact, he was treated as one who has attained a
      slight distinction. At least, he owned one superlative, no matter what its
      quality, and it lifted him out of the commonplace. It helped him to become
      better known, and boys liked to be seen with him. But one day, there was a
      rearrangement of the seating in the schoolroom: Wesley Bender was given a
      desk next in front of Dora Yocum's; and within a week the whole room knew
      that Wesley had begun voluntarily to wash his neck&mdash;the back of it,
      anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was at the bottom of the fight between Ramsey Milholland and Wesley
      Bender, and the diplomatic exchanges immediately preceding hostilities
      were charmingly frank and unhyprocitical, although quite as mixed-up and
      off-the-issue as if they had been prepared by professional foreign office
      men. Ramsey and Fred Mitchell and four other boys waylaid young Bender on
      the street after school, intending jocosities rather than violence, but
      the victim proved sensitive. &ldquo;You take your ole hands off o' me!&rdquo; he said
      fiercely, as they began to push him about among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ole dirty Wes!&rdquo; they hoarsely bellowed and squawked, in their changing
      voices. &ldquo;Washes his ears!&rdquo;... &ldquo;Washes his <i>neck!</i>&rdquo;... &ldquo;Dora Yocum
      told his mama to turn the hose on him!&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yay-ho! Ole dirty Wes tryin to
      be a duke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wesley broke from them and backed away, swinging his strapped books in a
      dangerous circle. &ldquo;You keep off!&rdquo; he warned them. &ldquo;I got as much right to
      my pers'nal appearance as anybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This richly fed their humour, and they rioted round him, keeping outside
      the swinging books at the end of the strap. &ldquo;Pers'nal appearance!&rdquo;... &ldquo;Who
      went and bought it for you, Wes?&rdquo;... &ldquo;Nobody bought it for him. Dora Yocum
      took and give him one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You leave ladies' names alone!&rdquo; cried the chivalrous Wesley. &ldquo;You ought
      to know better, on the public street, you&mdash;pups!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was a serious affront, at least to Ramsey Milholland's way of
      thinking; for Ramsey, also, now proved sensitive. He quoted his friends&mdash;&ldquo;Shut
      up!&rdquo;&mdash;and advanced toward Wesley. &ldquo;You look here! Who you callin'
      'pups'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody!&rdquo; Wesley hotly returned. &ldquo;Everybody that hasn't got any more
      decency than to go around mentioning ladies' names on the public streets.
      Everybody that goes around mentioning ladies' names on the public streets
      are pups!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are, are they?&rdquo; Ramsey as hotly demanded. &ldquo;Well, you just look here
      a minute; my own father mentions my mother's name on the public streets
      whenever he wants to, and you just try callin' my father a pup, and you
      won't know what happened to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll <i>you</i> do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put a new head on you,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;That's what I'll do, because
      anybody that calls my father or mother a pup&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut up! I wasn't talking about your ole father and mother. I said
      everybody that mentioned Dora Yocum's name on the public streets was a
      pup, and I mean it! Everybody that mentions Dora Yocum's name on the pub&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dora Yocum!&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;I got a perfect right to say it anywhere I
      want to. Dora Yocum, Dora Yocum, Dora Yocum!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then you're a pup!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey charged upon him and received a suffocating blow full in the face,
      not from Mr. Bender's fist but from the solid bundle of books at the end
      of the strap. Ramsey saw eight or ten objectives instantly: there were
      Wesley Benders standing full length in the air on top of other Wesley
      Benders, and more Wesley Benders zigzagged out sideways from still other
      Wesley Benders; nevertheless, he found one of these and it proved to be
      flesh. He engaged it wildly at fisticuffs; pounded it upon the countenance
      and drove it away. Then he sat down upon the curbstone, and, with his
      dizzy eyes shut, leaned forward for the better accommodation of his
      ensanguined nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wesley had retreated to the other side of the street holding a grimy
      handkerchief to the midmost parts of his pallid face. &ldquo;There, you ole damn
      pup!&rdquo; he shouted, in a voice which threatened to sob. &ldquo;I guess <i>that'll</i>
      teach you to be careful how you mention Dora Yocum's name on the public
      streets!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, Ramsey made a motion as if to rise and pursue, whereupon Wesley
      fled, wailing back over his shoulder as he ran, &ldquo;You wait till I ketch you
      out alone on the public streets and I'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was lost in an outburst of hooting from his former friends, who
      sympathetically surrounded the wounded Ramsey. But in a measure, at least,
      the chivalrous fugitive had won his point. He was routed and outdone, yet
      what survived the day was a rumour, which became a sort of tenuous legend
      among those interested. There had been a fight over Dora Yocum, it
      appeared, and Ramsey Milholland had attempted to maintain something
      derogatory to the lady, while Wesley defended her as a knightly youth
      should. The something derogatory was left vague; nobody attempted to say
      just what it was, and the effects of the legend divided the schoolroom
      strictly according to gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys, unmindful of proper gallantry, supported Ramsey on account of
      the way he had persisted in lickin' the stuffin' out of Wesley Bender
      after receiving that preliminary wallop from Wesley's blackjack bundle of
      books. The girls petted and championed Wesley; they talked outrageously of
      his conqueror, fiercely declaring that he ought to be arrested; and for
      weeks they maintained a new manner toward him. They kept their facial
      expressions hostile, but perhaps this was more for one another's benefit
      than for Ramsey's; and several of them went so far out of their way to
      find even private opportunities for reproving him that an alert observer
      might have suspected them to have been less indignant than they seemed&mdash;but
      not Ramsey. He thought they all hated him, and said he was glad of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora was a non-partisan. The little prig was so diligent at her books she
      gave never the slightest sign of comprehending that there had been a fight
      about her. Having no real cognizance of Messrs. Bender and Milholland
      except as impediments to the advance of learning, she did not even look
      demure.

    <h2>
      Chapter V
    </h2>
    <p>
      With Wesley Bender, Ramsey was again upon fair terms before the winter had
      run its course; the two were neighbours and, moreover, were drawn together
      by a community of interests which made their reconciliation a necessity.
      Ramsey played the guitar and Wesley played the mandolin.
    </p>
    <p>
      All ill feeling between them died with the first duet of spring, yet the
      twinkling they made had no charm to soothe the savage breast of Ramsey
      whenever the Teacher's Pet came into his thoughts. He daydreamed a
      thousand ways of putting her in her place, but was unable to carry out any
      of them, and had but a cobwebby satisfaction in imagining discomfitures
      for her which remained imaginary. With a yearning so poignant that it
      hurt, he yearned and yearned to show her what she really was. &ldquo;Just once!&rdquo;
       he said to Fred Mitchell. &ldquo;That's all I ask, just once. Just gimme one
      chance to show that girl what she really is. I guess if I ever get the
      chance she'll find out what's the matter with her, for <i>once</i> in her
      life, anyway!&rdquo; Thus it came to be talked about and understood and expected
      in Ramsey's circle, all male, that Dora Yocum's day was coming. The nature
      of the disaster was left vague, but there was no doubt in the world that
      retribution merely awaited its ideal opportunity. &ldquo;You'll see!&rdquo; said
      Ramsey. &ldquo;The time'll come when that ole girl'll wish she'd moved o' this
      town before she ever got appointed monitor of <i>our</i> class! Just you
      wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waited, but conditions appeared to remain unfavourable indefinitely.
      Perhaps the great opportunity might have arrived if Ramsey had been able
      to achieve a startling importance in any of the &ldquo;various divergent yet
      parallel lines of school endeavour&rdquo;&mdash;one of the phrases by means of
      which teachers and principal clogged the minds of their unarmed auditors.
      But though he was far from being the dumb driven beast of misfortune that
      he seemed in the schoolroom, and, in fact, lived a double life, exhibiting
      in his out-of-school hours a remarkable example of &ldquo;secondary personality&rdquo;&mdash;a
      creature fearing nothing and capable of laughter; blue-eyed, fairly
      robust, and anything but dumb&mdash;he was nevertheless without endowment
      or attainment great enough to get him distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He &ldquo;tried for&rdquo; the high-school eleven, and &ldquo;tried for&rdquo; the nine, but the
      experts were not long in eliminating him from either of these
      competitions, and he had to content himself with cheering instead of
      getting cheered. He was by no manner of means athlete enough, or enough of
      anything else, to put Dora Yocum in her place, and so he and the great
      opportunity were still waiting in May, at the end of the second year of
      high school, when the class, now the &ldquo;10 A,&rdquo; reverted to an old fashion
      and decided to entertain itself with a woodland picnic.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gathered upon the sandy banks of a creek, in the blue shade of big,
      patchy-barked sycamores, with a dancing sky on top of everything and gold
      dust atwinkle over the water. Hither the napkin-covered baskets were
      brought from the wagons and assembled in the shade, where they appeared as
      an attractive little meadow of white napery, and gave both surprise and
      pleasure to communities of ants and to other original settlers of the
      neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this nucleus or headquarters of the picnic, various expeditions set
      forth up and down the creek and through the woods that bordered it. Camera
      work was constant; spring wild flowers were accumulated by groups of girls
      who trooped through the woods with eager eyes searching the thickets; two
      envied boy fishermen established themselves upon a bank up-stream, with
      hooks and lines thoughtfully brought with them, and poles which they
      fashioned from young saplings. They took mussels from the shallows, for
      bait, and having gone to all this trouble, declined to share with friends
      less energetic and provident the perquisites and pleasures secured to
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert Paxton was another person who proved his enterprise. Having visited
      the spot some days before, he had hired for his exclusive use throughout
      the duration of the picnic an old rowboat belonging to a shanty squatter;
      it was the only rowboat within a mile or two and Albert had his own uses
      for it. Albert was the class lover and, after first taking the three
      chaperon teachers &ldquo;out for a row,&rdquo; an excursion concluded in about ten
      minutes, he disembarked them; Sadie Clews stepped into the boat, a pocket
      camera in one hand, a tennis racket in the other; and the two spent the
      rest of the day, except for the luncheon interval, solemnly drifting along
      the banks or grounded on a shoal. Now and then Albert would row a few
      strokes, and at almost any time when the populated shore glanced toward
      them, Sadie would be seen photographing Albert, or Albert would be seen
      photographing Sadie, but the tennis racket remained an enigma. Oarsman and
      passenger appeared to have no conversation whatever&mdash;not once was
      either seen or heard to address a remark to the other; and they looked as
      placid as their own upside-down reflections in one of the still pools they
      slowly floated over. They were sixteen, and had been &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; more than
      two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the borders of the little meadow of baskets there had been deposited
      two black shapes, which remained undisturbed throughout the day, a closed
      guitar case and a closed mandolin case, no doubt containing each its
      proper instrument. So far as any use of these went they seemed to be of
      the same leisure class to which Sadie's tennis racket belonged, for when
      one of the teachers suggested music, the musicians proved shy. Wesley
      Bender said they hadn't learned to play anything much and, besides, he had
      a couple o' broken strings he didn't know as he could fix up; and Ramsey
      said he guessed it seemed kind o' too hot to play much. Joining friends,
      they organized a contest in marksmanship, the target being a floating can
      which they assailed with pebbles; and after that they &ldquo;skipped&rdquo; flat
      stones upon the surface of the water, then went to join a group gathered
      about Willis Parker and Heinie Krusemeyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      No fish had been caught, a lack of luck crossly attributed by the
      fishermen to the noise made by constant advice on the part of their
      attendant gallery. Messrs. Milholland, Bender, and the other rock throwers
      came up shouting, and were ill received.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven's sakes,&rdquo; Heinie Krusemeyer demanded, &ldquo;can't you shut up? Here
      we just first got the girls to keep their mouths shut a minute and I
      almost had a big pickerel or something on my hook, and here you got to up
      and yell so he chases himself away! Why can't nobody show a little sense
      sometimes when they ought to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so!&rdquo; his comrade exclaimed. &ldquo;If people would only just take
      and think of all the trouble we been to, it seems funny somebody couldn't
      let us have half a chance to get a few good fish. What chance they got to
      bite with a lot o' <i>girls</i> gabbin' away, and then, just as we get 'em
      quieted down, all you men got to come bustin' up here yellin' your heads
      off. A fish isn't goin' to bite when he can't even hear himself think!
      Anybody ought to know that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the new arrivals hooted. <i>&ldquo;Fish!&rdquo;</i> Ramsey vociferated. &ldquo;I'll bet
      a hundred dollars there hasn't been even a minny in this creek for the
      last sixty years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is, too!&rdquo; said Heinie, bitterly. &ldquo;But I wouldn't be surprised there
      wouldn't be no longer if you got to keep up this noise. If you'd shut up
      just a minute you could see yourself there's fish here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In whispers several of the tamed girls at once heartily corroborated this
      statement, whereupon the newcomers ceased to gibe and consented to
      silence. Ramsey leaned forth over the edge of the overhanging bank, a dirt
      precipice five feet above the water, and peered into the indeterminable
      depths below. The pool had been stirred, partly by the inexpert pokings of
      the fishermen and partly by small clods and bits of dirt dislodged from
      above by the feet of the audience. The water, consequently, was but
      brownly translucent and revealed its secrets reluctantly; nevertheless
      certain dim little shapes had been observed to move within it, and were
      still there. Ramsey failed to see them at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's any ole fish?&rdquo; he inquired, scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my goodness!&rdquo; Heinie Krusemeyer moaned. &ldquo;<i>Can't</i> you shut up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; whispered the girl who stood nearest to Ramsey. She pointed.
      &ldquo;There's one. Right down there by Willis's hook. Don't you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey was impressed enough to whisper. &ldquo;Is there? I don't see him. I
      can't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl came closer to him, and, the better to show him, leaned out over
      the edge of the bank, and, for safety in maintaining her balance, rested
      her left hand upon his shoulder while she pointed with her right.
      Thereupon something happened to Ramsey. The touch upon his shoulder was
      almost nothing, and he had never taken the slightest interest in Milla
      Rust (to whom that small warm hand belonged), though she was the class
      beauty, and long established in the office. Now, all at once, a peculiar
      and heretofore entirely unfamiliar sensation suddenly became important in
      the upper part of his chest. For a moment he held his breath, an
      involuntary action;&mdash;he seemed to be standing in a shower of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see it, Ramsey?&rdquo; Milla whispered. &ldquo;It's a great big one. Why,
      it must be as long as&mdash;as your shoe! Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey saw nothing but the thick round curl on Milla's shoulder. Milla had
      a group of curls on each of her shoulders, for she got her modes at the
      Movies and had that sort of prettiness: large, gentle, calculating eyes,
      and a full, softly modelled face, implacably sweet. Ramsey was accustomed
      to all this charm, and Milla had never before been of more importance to
      him than an equal weight of school furniture&mdash;but all at once some
      magic had enveloped her. That curl upon the shoulder nearest him was shot
      with dazzling fibres of sunshine. He seemed to be trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see it,&rdquo; he murmured, huskily, afraid that she might remove her
      hand. &ldquo;I can't see any fish, Milla.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned farther out over the bank. &ldquo;Why, there, goosie!&rdquo; she whispered.
      &ldquo;Right there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned still farther, bending down to point. &ldquo;Why right th&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment she removed her hand from his shoulder, though unwillingly.
      She clutched at him, in fact, but without avail. She had been too amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud shriek was uttered by throats abler to vocalize, just then, than
      Milla's, for in her great surprise she said nothing whatever&mdash;the
      shriek came from the other girls as Milla left the crest of the
      overhanging bank and almost horizontally disappeared into the brown water.
      There was a tumultuous splash, and then of Milla Rust and her well-known
      beautifulness there was nothing visible in the superficial world, nor upon
      the surface of that creek. The vanishment was total.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Save</i> her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several girls afterward admitted having used this expression, and little
      Miss Floy Williams, the youngest and smallest member of the class, was
      unable to deny that she had said, &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; Nothing could have been more
      natural, and the matter need not have been brought before her with such
      insistence and frequency, during the two remaining years of her
      undergraduate career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey was one of those who heard this exclamation, later so famous, and
      perhaps it was what roused him to heroism. He dived from the bank,
      headlong, and the strange thought in his mind was &ldquo;I guess <i>this</i>'ll
      show Dora Yocum!&rdquo; He should have been thinking of Milla, of course, at
      such a time, particularly after the little enchantment just laid upon him
      by Milla's touch and Milla's curls; and he knew well enough that Miss
      Yocum was not among the spectators. She was half a mile away, as it
      happened, gathering &ldquo;botanical specimens&rdquo; with one of the teachers&mdash;which
      was her idea of what to do at a picnic!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey struck the water hard, and in the same instant struck something
      harder. Wesley Bender's bundle of books had given him no such shock as he
      received now, and if the creek bottom had not been of mud, just there, the
      top of his young head might have declined the strain. Half stunned,
      choking, spluttering he somehow floundered to his feet; and when he could
      get his eyes a little cleared of water he found himself wavering face to
      face with a blurred vision of Milla Rust. She had risen up out of the pond
      and stood knee deep, like a lovely drenched figure in a fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the bank above them, Willis Parker was jumping up and down,
      gesticulating and shouting fiercely. &ldquo;Now I guess you're satisfied our
      fishin' <i>is</i> spoilt! Whyn't you listen me? I <i>told</i> you it
      wasn't more'n three feet deep! I and Heinie waded all over this creek
      gettin' our bait. You're a pretty sight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of Milla he spoke unwittingly the literal truth. Even with her hair thus
      wild and sodden, Milla rose from immersion blushing and prettier than
      ever; and she was prettiest of all when she stretched out her hand
      helplessly to Ramsey and he led her up out of the waters. They had plenty
      of assistance to scramble to the top of the bank, and there Milla was
      surrounded and borne away with a great clacketing and tumult. Ramsey gave
      his coat into the hands of friends, who twisted the water out of it for
      him, while he sat upon the grass in the sun, rubbed his head, and
      experimented with his neck to see if it would &ldquo;work.&rdquo; The sunshine was
      strong and hot; in half an hour he and his clothes were dry&mdash;or at
      least &ldquo;dry enough,&rdquo; as he said, and except for some soreness of head and
      neck, and the general crumpledness of his apparel, he seemed to be in all
      ways much as usual when shouts and whistlings summoned all the party to
      luncheon at the rendezvous. The change that made him different was
      invisible.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The change in Ramsey was invisible, and yet something must have been seen,
      for everyone appeared to take it for granted that he was to sit next to
      Milla at the pastoral meal. She herself understood it, evidently, for she
      drew in her puckered skirts and without any words make a place for him
      beside her as he driftingly approached her, affecting to whistle and
      keeping his eyes on the foliage overhead. He still looked upward, even in
      the act of sitting down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squirrel or something,&rdquo; he said, feebly, as if in explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Milla asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up there on a branch.&rdquo; He accepted a plate from her (she had provided
      herself with an extra one), but he did not look at it or her. &ldquo;I'm not
      just exactly sure it's a squirrel,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Kind of hard to make out
      exactly what it is.&rdquo; He continued to keep his eyes aloft, because he
      imagined that all of the class were looking at him and Milla, and he felt
      unable to meet such publicity. It was to him as if the whole United States
      had been scandalized to attention by this act of his in going to sit
      beside Milla; he gazed upward so long that his eyeballs became sensitive
      under the strain. He began to blink. &ldquo;I can't make out whether it's a
      squirrel or just some leaves that kind o' got fixed like one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      can't make out yet which it is, but I guess when there's a breeze, if it's
      a squirrel he'll prob'ly hop around some then, if he's alive or anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had begun to seem that his eyes must remain fixed in that upward stare
      forever; he wanted to bring them down, but could not face the glare of the
      world. So the fugitive ostrich is said to bury his head in the sand; he
      does it, not believing himself thereby hidden but trying to banish from
      his own cognizance terrible facts which his unsheltered eyes have seemed
      to reveal. So, too, do nervous children seek to bury their eyes under
      pillows, and nervous statesmen theirs under oratory. Ramsey's ostrichings
      can happen to anybody. But finally the brightness of the sky between the
      leaves settled matters for him; he sneezed, wept, and for a little moment
      again faced his fellowmen. No one was looking at him; everybody except
      Milla had other things to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having sneezed involuntarily, he added a spell of coughing for which there
      was no necessity. &ldquo;I guess I must be wrong,&rdquo; he muttered thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About it bein' a squirrel.&rdquo; With infinite timidity he turned his head and
      encountered a gaze so soft, so hallowed, that it disconcerted him, and he
      dropped a &ldquo;drumstick&rdquo; of fried chicken, well dotted with ants, from his
      plate. Scarlet he picked it up, but did not eat it. For the first time in
      his life he felt that eating fried chicken held in the fingers was not to
      be thought of. He replaced the &ldquo;drumstick&rdquo; upon his plate and allowed it
      to remain there untouched, in spite of a great hunger for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having looked down, he now found difficulty in looking up, but gazed
      steadily at his plate, and into this limited circle of vision came Milla's
      delicate and rosy fingers, bearing a gift. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; she said in a motherly
      little voice. &ldquo;It's a tomato mayonnaise sandwich and I made it myself. I
      want you to eat it, Ramsey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His own fingers approached tremulousness as he accepted the thick sandwich
      from her and conveyed it to his mouth. A moment later his soul filled with
      horror, for a spurt of mayonnaise dressing had caused a catastrophe the
      scene of which occupied no inconsiderable area of his right cheek; which
      was the cheek toward Milla. He groped wretchedly for his handkerchief but
      could not find it; he had lost it. Sudden death would have been relief; he
      was sure that after such grotesquerie Milla could never bear to have
      anything more to do with him; he was ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his anguish he felt a paper napkin pressed gently into his hand; a soft
      voice said in his ear, &ldquo;Wipe it off with this, Ramsey. Nobody's noticing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So this incredibly charitable creature was still able to be his friend,
      even after seeing him mayonnaised! Humbly marvelling, he did as she told
      him, but avoided all further risks. He ate nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed his first sigh of inexpressibleness, had a chill or so along the
      spine, and at intervals his brow was bedewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within his averted eyes there dwelt not the Milla Rust who sat beside him,
      but an iridescent, fragile creature who had become angelic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent the rest of the day dawdling helplessly about her; wherever she
      went he was near, as near as possible, but of no deliberate volition of
      his own. Something seemed to tie him to her, and Milla was nothing loth.
      He seldom looked at her directly, or for longer than an instant, and more
      rarely still did he speak to her except as a reply. What few remarks he
      ventured upon his own initiative nearly all concerned the landscape, which
      he commended repeatedly in a weak voice, as &ldquo;kind of pretty,&rdquo; though once
      he said he guessed there might be bugs in the bark of a log on which they
      sat; and he became so immoderately personal as to declare that if the bugs
      had to get on anybody he'd rather they got on him than on Milla. She said
      that was &ldquo;just perfectly lovely&rdquo; of him, asked where he got his sweet
      nature, and in other ways encouraged him to continue the revelation, but
      Ramsey was unable to get forward with it, though he opened and closed his
      mouth a great many times in the effort to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o'clock everybody was summoned again to the rendezvous for a
      ceremony preliminary to departure: the class found itself in a large
      circle, standing, and sang &ldquo;The Star Spangled Banner.&rdquo; Ordinarily, on such
      an open-air and out-of-school occasion, Ramsey would have joined the
      chorus uproariously with the utmost blatancy of which his vocal apparatus
      was capable; and most of the other boys expressed their humour by drowning
      out the serious efforts of the girls; but he sang feebly, not much more
      than humming through his teeth. Standing beside Milla, he was incapable of
      his former inelegancies and his voice was in a semi-paralyzed condition,
      like the rest of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite him, across the circle, Dora Yocum stood a little in advance of
      those near her, for of course she led the singing. Her clear and earnest
      voice was distinguishable from all others, and though she did not glance
      toward Ramsey he had a queer feeling that she was assuming more
      superiority than ever, and that she was icily scornful of him and Milla.
      The old resentment rose&mdash;he'd &ldquo;show&rdquo; that girl yet, some day!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the song was over, cheers were given for the class, &ldquo;the good ole
      class of Nineteen Fourteen,&rdquo; the school, the teachers, and for the picnic,
      thus officially concluded; and then the picnickers, carrying their baskets
      and faded wild flowers and other souvenirs and burdens, moved toward the
      big &ldquo;express wagons&rdquo; which were to take them back into the town. Ramsey
      got his guitar case, and turned to Milla.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well what, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;g'bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Milla. &ldquo;Anyways not yet. You can go back in the same wagon
      with me. It's going to stop at the school and let us out there, and then
      you could walk home with me if you felt like it. You could come all the
      way to our gate with me, I expect, unless you'd be late home for your
      supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, I'd be perfectly willing,&rdquo; Ramsey said. &ldquo;Only I heard we
      all had to go back in whatever wagon we came out in, and I didn't come in
      the same wagon with you, so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milla laughed and leaned toward him a little. &ldquo;I already 'tended to that,&rdquo;
       she said confidentially. &ldquo;I asked Johnnie Fiske, that came out in my
      wagon, to go back in yours, so that makes room for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;then I guess I could do it.&rdquo; He moved toward the wagon with
      her. &ldquo;I expect it don't make much difference one way or the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you can carry my basket if you want to,&rdquo; she said, adding
      solicitously, &ldquo;Unless it's too heavy when you already got your guitar case
      to carry, Ramsey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This thoughtfulness of hers almost overcame him; she seemed divine. He
      gulped, and emotion made him even pinker than he had been under the
      mayonnaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I'll be glad to carry the basket, too,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;It-it don't
      weigh anything much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let's hurry, so's we can get places together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as she manoeuvred him through the little crowd about the wagon, with
      a soft push this way and a gentle pull that, and hurried him up the
      improvised steps and found a place where there was room for them to sit,
      Ramsey had another breathless sensation heretofore unknown to him. He
      found himself taken under a dovelike protectorship; a wonderful,
      inexpressible Being seemed to have become his proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't this just perfectly lovely?&rdquo; she said cozily, close to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swallowed, but found no words, for he had no thoughts; he was only an
      incoherent tumult. This was his first love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it, Ramsey?&rdquo; she urged. The cozy voice had just the hint of a
      reproach. &ldquo;Don't you think it's just perfectly lovely, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Ramsey came into his father's room while Mr. Milholland
      was shaving, an hour before church time, and it became apparent that the
      son had someting on his mind, though for a while he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want anything, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't want to borrow my razors?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Milholland chuckled. &ldquo;I hardly supposed so, seriously! Shaving is a
      great nuisance and the longer you keep away from it, the better. And when
      you do, you let my razors alone, young feller!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; (Mr. Milholland's razors were safe, Ramsey had already
      achieved one of his own, but he practised the art in secret.) He passed
      his hand thoughtfully over his cheeks, and traces of white powder were
      left upon his fingers, whereupon he wiped his hand surreptitiously, and
      stood irresolutely waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you really want, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I don't want anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. You gay' me some Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Milholland turned from his mirror and looked over the edge of a towel
      at his son. In the boy's eyes there was such a dumb agony of interrogation
      that the father was a little startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is it, Ramsey? Have you&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, frowning and
      wondering. &ldquo;You haven't been getting into some mess you want to tell me
      about, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was meek, but a mute distress lurked within it, bringing to the
      father's mind disturbing suspicions, and foreshadowings of indignation and
      of pity. &ldquo;See here, Ramsey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if there's anything you want to ask
      me, or to tell me, you'd better out with it and get it over. Now, what is
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;it isn't anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you <i>sure?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey's eyes fell before the severe and piercing gaze of his father.
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Milholland shook his head doubtfully; then, as his son walked slowly
      out of the room, he turned to complete his toilet in a somewhat uneasy
      frame of mind. Ramsey had undoubtedly wanted to say something to him and
      the boy's expression had shown that the matter in question was serious,
      distressing, and, it might be, even critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact it was&mdash;to Ramsey. Having begun within only the last few
      hours to regard haberdashery as of vital importance, and believing his
      father to be possessed of the experience and authority lacking in himself,
      Ramsey had come to get him to settle a question which had been upsetting
      him badly, in his own room, since breakfast. What he wanted to know was:
      Whether it was right to wear an extra handkerchief showing out of the coat
      breast pocket or not, and, if it was right&mdash;ought the handkerchief to
      have a coloured border or to be plain white? But he had never before
      brought any such perplexities to his father, and found himself too
      diffident to set them forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when he left the house, a few minutes later, he boldly showed an
      inch of purple border above the pocket; then, as he was himself about to
      encounter several old lady pedestrians, he blushed and thrust the
      handkerchief down into deep concealment. Having gone a block farther, he
      pulled it up again; and so continued to operate this badge of fashion, or
      unfashion, throughout the morning; and suffered a great deal thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, his father, rather relieved that Ramsey had not told his secret,
      whatever it was, dismissed the episode from his mind and joined Mrs.
      Milholland at the front door, ready for church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Ramsey?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone ahead,&rdquo; she answered, buttoning her gloves as they went along.
      &ldquo;I heard the door quite a little while ago. Perhaps he went over to walk
      down with Charlotte and Vance. Did you notice how neat he looks this
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, I didn't; not particularly. Does he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw anything like it before,&rdquo; said Mrs. Milholland. &ldquo;He went down
      in the cellar and polished his own shoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For about an hour, I think,&rdquo; she said, as one remaining calm before a
      miracle. &ldquo;And he only has three neckties, but I saw him several times in
      each of them. He must have kept changing and changing. I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;
       She paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad he's begun to take a little care of his appearance at last.
      Business men think a good deal about that, these days, when he comes to
      make his start in the world. I'll have to take a look at him and give him
      a word of praise. I suppose he'll be in the pew when we get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ramsey wasn't in the pew; and Charlotte, his sister, and her husband,
      who were there, said they hadn't seen anything of him. It was not until
      the members of the family were on their way home after the services that
      they caught a glimpse of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were passing a church a little distance from their own; here the
      congregation was just emerging to the open, and among the sedate throng
      descending the broad stone steps appeared an accompanied Ramsey&mdash;and
      a red, red Ramsey he was when he beheld his father and mother and sister
      and brother-in-law staring up at him from the pavement below. They were
      kind enough not to come to an absolute halt, but passed slowly on, so that
      he was just able to avoid parading up the street in front of them. The
      expressions of his father, mother, and sister were of a dumfoundedness
      painful to bear, while such lurking jocosity as that apparent all over his
      brother-in-law no dignified man should either exhibit or be called upon to
      ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In hoarse whispers, Mrs. Milholland chided her husband for an exclamation
      he had uttered. &ldquo;John! On Sunday! You ought to be ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't help it,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Who on earth is his clinging vine?
      Why, she's got <i>lavender</i> tops on her shoes and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look round!&rdquo; she warned him sharply. &ldquo;Don't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what's he doing at a Baptist church? What's he fidgeting at his
      handkerchief about? Why can't he walk like people? Does he think it's
      obligatory to walk home from church anchored arm-in-arm like Swedes on a
      Sunday Out? Who <i>is</i> this cow-eyed fat girl that's got him, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! Don't look round again, John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear!&rdquo; said her husband, having disobeyed. &ldquo;They've turned off;
      they're crossing over to Bullard Street. Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think her name's Rust,&rdquo; Mrs. Milholland informed him. &ldquo;I don't know
      what her father does. She's one of the girls in his class at school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's just like a boy; pick out some putty-faced flirt to take to
      church!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she's quite pretty&mdash;in that way!&rdquo; said his wife, deprecatingly.
      &ldquo;Of course that's the danger with public schools. It would be pleasanter
      if he'd taken a fancy to someone whose family belongs to our own circle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Taken a fancy'!&rdquo; he echoed, hooting. &ldquo;Why, he's terrible! He looked like
      a red-gilled goldfish that's flopped itself out of the bowl. Why, he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>say</i> I wish if he felt that he had to take girls anywhere,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Milholland, with the primmest air of speaking to the point&mdash;&ldquo;if
      this sort of thing <i>must</i> begin, I wish he might have selected some
      nice girl among the daughters of our own friends, like Dora Yocum, for
      instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the spot she began to undergo the mortification of a mother who has
      expected her son, just out of infancy, to look about him with the eye of a
      critical matron of forty-five. Moreover, she was indiscreet enough to
      express her views to Ramsey, a week later, producing thus a scene of
      useless great fury and no little sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do think it's in <i>very</i> poor taste to see so much of any one girl,
      Ramsey,&rdquo; she said, and, not heeding his protest that he only walked home
      from school with Milla, &ldquo;about every other day,&rdquo; and that it didn't seem
      any crime to him just to go to church with her a couple o' times, Mrs.
      Milholland went on: &ldquo;But if you think you really <i>must</i> be dangling
      around somebody quite this much&mdash;though what in the world you find to
      <i>talk</i> about with this funny little Milla Rust you poor father says
      he really cannot see&mdash;and of course it seems very queer to us that
      you'd be willing to waste so much time just now when your mind ought to be
      entirely on your studies, and especially with such an absurd <i>looking</i>
      little thing&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you must listen, Ramsey, and let me speak now. What I meant was that
      we shouldn't be <i>quite</i> so much distressed by your being seen with a
      girl who dressed in better taste and seemed to have some notion of
      refinement, though of course it's only natural she <i>wouldn't</i>, with a
      father who is just a sort of ward politician, I understand, and a mother
      we don't know, and of course shouldn't care to. But, oh, Ramsey! if you <i>had</i>
      to make yourself so conspicuous why couldn't you be a little <i>bit</i>
      more fastidious? Your father wouldn't have minded nearly so much if it had
      been a self-respecting, intellectual girl. We both say that if you <i>must</i>
      be so ridiculous at your age as to persist in seeing more of one girl than
      another, why, oh why, don't you go and see some really nice girl like Dora
      Yocum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey was already dangerously distended, as an effect of the earlier part
      of her discourse, and the word &ldquo;fastidious&rdquo; almost exploded him; but upon
      the climax, &ldquo;Dora Yocum,&rdquo; he blew up with a shattering report and, leaving
      fragments of incoherence ricocheting behind him, fled shuddering from the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest of the school term he walked home with Milla every afternoon
      and on Sundays appeared to have become a resolute Baptist. It was supposed
      (by the interested members of the high-school class) that Ramsey and Milla
      were &ldquo;engaged.&rdquo; Ramsey sometimes rather supposed they were himself, and
      the dim idea gave him a sensation partly pleasant, but mostly
      apprehensive: he was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was afraid that the day was coming when he ought to kiss her.

    <h2>
      Chapter VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Vacation, in spite of increased leisure, may bring inconvenience to people
      in Ramsey's strange but not uncommon condition. At home his constant air
      was that of a badgered captive plaintively silent under injustice; and he
      found it difficult to reply calmly when asked where he was going&mdash;an
      inquiry addressed to him, he asserted, every time he touched his cap, even
      to hang it up!
    </p>
    <p>
      The amount of evening walking he did must also have been a trial to his
      nerves, on account of fatigue, though the ground covered was not vast.
      Milla's mother and father were friendly people but saw no reason to &ldquo;move
      out of house and home,&rdquo; as Mr. Rust said, when Milla had &ldquo;callers&rdquo;; and on
      account of the intimate plan of their small dwelling a visitor's only
      alternative to spending the evening with Mr. and Mrs. Rust as well as with
      Milla, was to invite her to &ldquo;go out walking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evening after evening they walked and walked and walked, usually in
      company&mdash;at perhaps the distance of half a block&mdash;with Albert
      Paxton and Sadie Clews, though Ramsey now and then felt disgraced by
      having fallen into this class; for sometimes it was apparent that Albert
      casually had his arm about Sadie's waist. This allured Ramsey somewhat,
      but terrified him more. He didn't know how such matters were managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually the quartet had no destination; they just went &ldquo;out walking&rdquo; until
      ten o'clock, when both girls had to be home&mdash;and the boys did, too,
      but never admitted it. On Friday evenings there was a &ldquo;public open-air
      concert&rdquo; by a brass band in a small park, and the four were always there.
      A political speechmaker occupied the bandstand one night, and they stood
      for an hour in the midst of the crowd, listening vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orator saddled his politics upon patriotism. &ldquo;Do you intend to let
      this glorious country go to wrack and ruin, oh, my good friends,&rdquo; he
      demanded, &ldquo;or do you intend to save her? Look forth upon this country of
      ours, I bid you, oh, my countrymen, and tell me what you see. You see a
      fair domain of forest, mountain, plain, and fertile valleys, sweeping from
      ocean to ocean. Look from the sturdy rocks of old New England, pledged to
      posterity by the stern religious hardihood of the Pilgrim Fathers, across
      the corn-bearing midland country, that land of milk and honey, won for us
      by the pluck and endurance of the indomitable pioneers, to where in
      sunshine roll the smiling Sierras of golden California, given to our
      heritage by the unconquerable energy of those brave men and women who
      braved the tomahawk on the Great Plains, the tempest, of Cape Horn, and
      the fevers of Panama, to make American soil of El Dorado! America! Oh, my
      America, how glorious you stand! Country of Washington and Valley Forge,
      out of what martyrdoms hast thou arisen! Country of Lincoln in his box at
      Ford's theatre, his lifeblood staining to a brighter, holier red the red,
      white, and blue of the Old Flag! Always and always I see the Old Flag
      fluttering the more sacredly encrimsoned in the breeze for the martyrs who
      have upheld it! Always I see that Old Flag&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milla gave Ramsey's arm, within her own, a little tug. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Sade says she don't want to hang around here any longer. It's awful
      tiresome. Let's go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He consented, placidly. The oration meant nothing to him and stirred no
      one in the audience. The orator was impassioned; he shouted himself into
      coughing fits, gesticulated, grew purple; he was so hot that his collar
      caved in and finally swooned upon his neck in soggy exhaustion, prostrate
      round his thunderings. Meanwhile, the people listened with an air of
      patience, yawning here and there, and gradually growing fewer. It was the
      old, old usual thing, made up of phrases that Ramsey had heard dinning
      away on a thousand such occasions, and other kinds of occasions, until
      they meant to him no more than so much sound. He was bored, and glad to
      leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind o' funny,&rdquo; he said, as they sagged along the street at their usual
      tortoise gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems kind o' funny they never have anything to say any one can take any
      interest in. Always the same ole whoopety-whoop about George Washington
      and Pilgrim Fathers and so on. I bet five dollars before long we'd of
      heard him goin' on about our martyred Presidents, William McKinley and
      James A. Garfield and Benjamin Harrison and all so on, and then some more
      about the ole Red, White, and Blue. Don't you wish they'd <i>quit</i>,
      sometimes, about the 'Ole Flag'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Milla. &ldquo;I wasn't listening any at all. I hate speeches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I could <i>stand</i> 'em,&rdquo; Ramsey said, more generously, &ldquo;if they'd
      ever give anybody a little to think about. What's the use always draggin'
      in George Warshington and the Ole Flag? And who wants to hear any more ole
      truck about 'from ole rocky New England to golden California,' and how big
      and fine the United States is and how it's the land of the Free and all
      that? Why don't they ever say anything new? That's what I'd like to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Milla laughed, and when he asked why, she told him she'd never heard him
      talk so much &ldquo;at one stretch.&rdquo; &ldquo;I guess that speech got you kind of wound
      up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let's talk about something different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just soon,&rdquo; he agreed. And so they walked on in silence, which seemed
      to suit Milla. She hung weightily upon his arm, and they dawdled, drifting
      from one side of the pavement to the other as they slowly advanced. Albert
      and Sadie, ahead of them, called &ldquo;good-night&rdquo; from a corner, before
      turning down the side street where Sadie lived; and then, presently,
      Ramsey and Milla were at the latter's gate. He went in with her, halting
      at the front steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, g'night, Milla,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Want to go out walking to-morrow night?
      Albert and Sadie are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't to-morrow night,&rdquo; she told him with obvious regret. &ldquo;Isn't it the
      worst luck! I got an aunt comin' to visit from Chicago, and she's crazy
      about playing 'Five Hundred,' and Mama and Papa said I haf to stay in to
      make four to play it. She's liable to be here three or four days, and I
      guess I got to be around home pretty much all the time she's here. It's
      the worst luck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was doleful, but ventured to be literary. &ldquo;Well, what can't be helped
      must be endured. I'll come around when she's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved as if to depart, but she still retained his arm and did not
      prepare to relinquish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well what, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;g'night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced up at the dark front of the house. &ldquo;I guess the family's gone
      to bed,&rdquo; she said, absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I s'pose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-night, Ramsey.&rdquo; She said this but still did not release his
      arm, and suddenly, in a fluster, he felt that the time he dreaded had
      come. Somehow, without knowing where, except that it was somewhere upon
      what seemed to be a blurred face too full of obstructing features, he
      kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned instantly away in the darkness, her hands over her cheeks; and
      in a panic Ramsey wondered if he hadn't made a dreadful mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S'cuse me!&rdquo; he said, stumbling toward the gate. &ldquo;Well, I guess I got to
      be gettin' along back home.&rdquo;

      Chapter IX

      He woke in the morning to a great self-loathing: he had kissed a girl.
      Mingled with the loathing was a curious pride in the very fact that caused
      the loathing, but the pride did not last long. He came downstairs morbid
      to breakfast, and continued this mood afterward. At noon Albert Paxton
      brought him a note which Milla had asked Sadie to ask Albert to give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearie: I am just wondering if you thought as much about something so
      sweet that happened last night as I did you know what. I think it was the
      sweetest thing. I send you one with this note and I hope you will think it
      is a sweet one. I would give you a real one if you were here now and I
      hope you would think it was sweeter still than the one I put in this note.
      It is the sweetest thing now you are mine and I am yours forever kiddo. If
      you come around about friday eve it will be all right. aunt Jess will be
      gone back home by then so come early and we will get Sade and Alb and go
      to the band Concert. Don't forget what I said about my putting something
      sweet in this note, and I hope you will think it is a sweet one but not as
      sweet as the <i>real</i> sweet one I would like to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Ramsey impulsively tore the note into small pieces. He
      turned cold as his imagination projected a sketch of his mother in the act
      of reading this missive, and of her expression as she read the sentence:
      &ldquo;It is the sweetest thing now you are mine and I am yours forever kiddo.&rdquo;
       He wished that Milla hadn't written &ldquo;kiddo.&rdquo; She called him that,
      sometimes, but in her warm little voice the word seemed not at all what it
      did in ink. He wished, too, that she hadn't said she was his forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he was seized with a horror of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moisture broke out heavily upon him; he felt a definite sickness, and,
      wishing for death, went forth upon the streets to walk and walk. He cared
      not whither, so that his feet took him in any direction away from Milla,
      since they were unable to take him away from himself&mdash;of whom he had
      as great a horror. Her loving face was continually before him, and its
      sweetness made his flesh creep. Milla had been too sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he met or passed people, it seemed to him that perhaps they were able
      to recognize upon him somewhere the marks of his low quality. &ldquo;Softy! Ole
      sloppy fool!&rdquo; he muttered, addressing himself. &ldquo;Slushy ole mush!... <i>Spooner!</i>&rdquo;
       And he added, &ldquo;Yours forever, kiddo!&rdquo; Convulsions seemed about to seize
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning a corner with his head down, he almost charged into Dora Yocum.
      She was homeward bound from a piano lesson, and carried a rolled leather
      case of sheet music&mdash;something he couldn't imagine Milla carrying&mdash;and
      in her young girl's dress, which attempted to be nothing else, she looked
      as wholesome as cold spring water. Ramsey had always felt that she
      despised him and now, all at once, he thought that she was justified.
      Leper that he had become, he was unworthy to be even touching his cap to
      her! And as she nodded and went briskly on, he would have given anything
      to turn and walk a little way with her, for it seemed to him that this
      might fumigate his morals. But he lacked the courage, and, besides, he
      considered himself unfit to be seen walking with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a long afternoon of anguishes, these becoming most violent when he
      tried to face the problem of his future course toward Milla. He did not
      face it at all, in fact, but merely writhed, and had evolved nothing when
      Friday evening was upon him and Milla waiting for him to take her to the
      &ldquo;band concert&rdquo; with &ldquo;Alb and Sade.&rdquo; In his thoughts, by that time, this
      harmless young pair shared the contamination of his own crime, and he
      regarded them with aversion; however, he made shift to seek a short
      interview with Albert, just before dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a pretty rotten headache, and my stomach's upset, too,&rdquo; he said,
      drooping upon the Paxton's fence. &ldquo;I been gettin' worse every minute. You
      and Sadie go by Milla's, Albert, and tell her if I'm not there by
      ha'-pas'-seven, tell her not to wait for me any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean 'wait'?&rdquo; Albert inquired. &ldquo;You don't expect her to come
      pokin' along with Sadie and me, do you? She'll keep on sittin' there at
      home just the same, because she wouldn't have anything else to do, if you
      don't come like she expects you to. She hasn't got any way to <i>stop</i>
      waitin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, Ramsey moaned, without affectation. &ldquo;I don't expect I <i>can</i>,
      Albert,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'd like to if I could, but the way it looks now, you
      tell her I wouldn't be much surprised maybe I was startin' in with typhoid
      fever or pretty near anything at all. You tell her I'm pretty near as
      disappointed as she's goin' to be herself, and I'd come if I could&mdash;and
      I <i>will</i> come if I get a good deal better, or anything&mdash;but the
      way it's gettin' to look now, I kind o' feel as if I might be breaking out
      with something any minute.&rdquo; He moved away, concluding, feebly: &ldquo;I guess I
      better crawl on home, Albert, while I'm still able to walk some. You tell
      her the way it looks now I'm liable to be right sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the next morning he woke to the chafings of remorse, picturing a Milla
      somewhat restored in charm waiting hopefully at the gate, even after
      half-past seven, and then, as time passed and the sound of the distant
      horns came faintly through the darkness, going sadly to her room&mdash;perhaps
      weeping there. It was a picture to wring him with shame and pity, but was
      followed by another which electrified him, for out of school he did not
      lack imagination. What if Albert had reported his illness too vividly to
      Milla? Milla was so fond! What if, in her alarm, she should come here to
      the house to inquire of his mother about him? What if she told Mrs.
      Milholland they were &ldquo;engaged&rdquo;? The next moment Ramsey was projecting a
      conversation between his mother and Milla in which the latter stated that
      she and Ramsey were soon to be married; that she regarded him as already
      virtually her husband, and demanded to nurse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a panic he fled from the house before breakfast, going out by way of a
      side door, and he crossed back yards and climbed back fences to reach
      Albert Paxton the more swiftly. This creature, a ladies' man almost
      professionally, was found exercising with an electric iron and a pair of
      flannel trousers in a basement laundry, by way of stirring his appetite
      for the morning meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Albert,&rdquo; his friend said breathlessly. &ldquo;I got a favour. I want
      you to go over to Milla's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' to finish pressin' these trousers,&rdquo; Albert interrupted. &ldquo;Then
      I've got my breakfast to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you could do this first,&rdquo; said Ramsey, hurriedly. &ldquo;It wouldn't hurt
      you to do me this little favour first. You just slip over and see Milla
      for me, if she's up yet, and if she isn't, you better wait around there
      till she is, because I want you to tell her I'm a whole lot better this
      morning. Tell her I'm pretty near practick'ly all right again, Albert, and
      I'll prob'ly write her a note or something right soon&mdash;or in a week
      or so, anyhow. You tell her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you act pretty funny!&rdquo; Albert exclaimed, fumbling in the pockets of
      his coat. &ldquo;Why can't you go on over and tell her yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;I'd be perfectly willing to go only I got to get
      back home to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albert stared. &ldquo;Well, I got to go upstairs and eat my own breakfast in
      about a minute, haven't I? But just as it happens there wouldn't be any
      use your goin' over there, or me, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milla ain't there,&rdquo; said Albert, still searching the pockets of his coat.
      &ldquo;When we went by her house last night to tell her about your headache and
      stomach and all, why, her mother told us Milla'd gone up to Chicago
      yesterday afternoon with her aunt, and said she left a note for you, and
      she said if you were sick I better take it and give it to you. I was goin'
      to bring it over to your house after breakfast.&rdquo; He found it. &ldquo;Here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey thanked him feebly, and departed in a state of partial
      stupefaction, brought on by a glimpse of the instabilities of life. He had
      also, not relief, but a sense of vacancy and loss; for Milla, out of his
      reach, once more became mysteriously lovely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing in an alley, he read her note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dearie: Thought I ought to call you up but over the 'phone is just nix for
      explanations as Mama and Aunt Jess would hear everything and thought I
      might seem cold to you not saying anything sweet on account of them
      listening and you would wonder why I was so cold when telling you good-by
      for a wile maybe weeks. It is this way Uncle Purv wired Aunt Jess he has
      just taken in a big touring car on a debt and his vacation starts
      to-morrow so if they were going to take a trip they better start right way
      so Aunt Jess invited me. It is going to be a big trip up around the lakes
      and I have always wanted to go touring more than anything in the world
      stopping at hotels and all and Mama said I ought to it would be so
      splendid for my health as she thinks I am failing some lately. Now dearie
      I have to pack and write this in a hurry so you will not be disappointed
      when you come by for the B. C. to-night. Do not go get some other girl and
      take her for I would hate her and nothing in this world make me false for
      one second to my kiddo boy. I do not know just when home again as the
      folks think I better stay up there for a visit at Aunt Jess and Uncle
      Purvs home in Chicago after the trip is over. But I will think of you all
      the time and you must think of me every minute and believe your own dearie
      she will never no not for one second be false. So tell Sade and Alb
      good-by for me and do not be false to me any more than I would be to you
      and it will not be long till nothing more will interrupt our sweet
      friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a measure of domestic prudence, Ramsey tore the note into irreparable
      fragments, but he did this slowly, and without experiencing any of the
      revulsion created by Milla's former missive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was melancholy, aggrieved that she should treat him so.

      He never saw her again. She sent him a &ldquo;picture postal&rdquo; from Oconomowoc,
      Wisconsin, which his father disengaged from the family mail, one morning
      at breakfast, and considerately handed to him without audible comment.
      Upon it was written, <i>&ldquo;Oh, you Ramsey!&rdquo;</i> This was the last of Milla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before school opened, in the autumn, Sadie Clews made some
      revelations. &ldquo;Milla did like you,&rdquo; said Sadie. &ldquo;After that time you jumped
      in the creek to save her she liked you better than any boy in town, and I
      guess if it wasn't for her cousin Milt up in Chicago she would of liked
      you the best anywhere. I guess she did, anyway, because she hadn't seen
      him for about a year then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that afternoon she went away I was over there and took in
      everything that was goin' on, only she made me promise on my word of
      honour I wouldn't even tell Albert. They didn't get any wire from her
      uncle about the touring car; it was her cousin Milt that jumped on the
      train and came down and fixed it all up for Milla to go on the trip, and
      everything. You see, Ramsey, she was turned back a couple of times in
      school before she came in our class and I don't exactly know how old she
      is and she don't <i>look</i> old yet, but I'm pretty sure she's at least
      eighteen, and she might be over. Her mother kept tellin' her all the time
      you were just a kid, and didn't have anything to support her on, and lots
      of things like that. I didn't think such a great deal of this Milt's
      looks, myself, but he's anyway twenty-one years old, and got a good
      position, and all their family seem to think he's just fine! It wasn't his
      father that took in the touring car on debt, like she said she was writing
      to you; it was Milt himself. He started out in business when he was only
      fifteen years old, and this trip he was gettin' up for his father and
      mother and Milla was the first vacation he ever took. Well, of course she
      wouldn't like my tellin' you, but I can't see the harm of it, now
      everything's all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&mdash;all over? You mean Milla's going to be&mdash;to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She already is,&rdquo; said Sadie. &ldquo;They got married at her Aunt Jess and Uncle
      Purv's house, up in Chicago, last Thursday. Yes, sir; that quiet little
      Milla's a regular old married woman by this time, I expect, Ramsey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he got over the shock, which was not until the next day, one
      predominating feeling remained: it was a gloomy pride&mdash;a pride in his
      proven maturity. He was old enough, it appeared, to have been the same
      thing as engaged to a person who was now a Married Woman. His manner
      thenceforth showed an added trace of seriousness and self-consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having recovered his equipoise and something more, he entirely forgot that
      moment of humble admiration he had felt for Dora Yocum on the day of his
      flattest prostration. When he saw her sitting in the classroom, smiling
      brightly up at the teacher, the morning of the school's opening in the
      autumn, all his humility had long since vanished and she appeared to him
      not otherwise than as the scholar whose complete proficiency had always
      been so irksome to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at her!&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;Same ole Teacher's Pet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now and then, as the days and seasons passed, and Dora's serene progress
      continued, never checked or even flawed, there stirred within some
      lingerings of the old determination to &ldquo;show&rdquo; her; and he would conjure up
      a day-dream of Dora in loud lamentation, while he led the laughter of the
      spectators. But gradually his feelings about her came to be merely a dull
      oppression. He was tired of having to look at her (as he stated it) and he
      thanked the Lord that the time wouldn't be so long now until he'd be out
      of that ole school, and then all he'd have to do he'd just take care never
      to walk by her house; it was easy enough to use some other street when he
      had to go down-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good ole class of Nineteen-Fourteen is about gone,&rdquo; he said to Fred
      Mitchell, who was still his most intimate friend when they reached the
      senior year. &ldquo;Yes, sir; it's held together a good many years, Fred, but
      after June it'll be busted plum up, and I hope nobody starts a move to
      have any reunions. There's a good many members of the ole class that I can
      stand and there's some I can't, but there's one I just won't! If we ever
      did call a reunion, that ole Yocum girl would start in right away and run
      the whole shebang, and that's where I'd resign! You know, Fred, the thing
      <i>I</i> think is the one biggest benefit of graduating from this ole
      school? It's never seein' Dora Yocum again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was again his theme as he sat by the same friend's side, in the rear
      row of the class at Commencement, listening to the delivery of the
      Valedictory. &ldquo;Thinks she's just sooblime, don't she!&rdquo; he whispered
      morosely. &ldquo;She wouldn't trade with the President of the United States
      right now. She prob'ly thinks bein' Valedictorian is more important than
      Captain of the State University Eleven. Never mind!&rdquo; And here his tone
      became huskily jubilant. &ldquo;Never mind! Just about a half-an-hour more and
      that's the last o' <i>you</i>, ole girl! Yes, sir, Fred; one thing we can
      feel pretty good over: this is where we get through with Dora Yocum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey and Fred had arranged to room together at Greenfield, the seat of
      the state university, and they made the short journey in company the
      following September. They arrived hilarious, anticipating pleasurable
      excitements in the way of &ldquo;fraternity&rdquo; pledgings and initiations,
      encounters with sophomores, class meetings, and elections; and, also, they
      were not absolutely without interest in the matter of Girls, for the state
      university was co-educational, and it was but natural to expect in so
      broad a field, all new to them, a possible vision of something rather
      thrilling. They whispered cheerfully of all these things during the
      process of matriculation, and signed the registrar's book on a fresh page;
      but when Fred had written his name under Ramsey's, and blotted it, he took
      the liberty of turning over the leaf to examine some of the autographs of
      their future classmates, written on the other side. Then he uttered an
      exclamation, more droll than dolorous, though it affected to be wholly the
      latter; for the shock to Fred was by no means so painful as it was to his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey leaned forward and read the name indicated by Fred's forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dora Yocum.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      ...When they got back to their pleasant quarters at Mrs. Meig's, facing
      the campus, Ramsey was still unable to talk of anything except the
      lamentable discovery; nor were his companion's burlesquing efforts to
      console him of great avail, though Fred did become serious enough to point
      out that a university was different from a high school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not like havin' to use one big room as a headquarters, you know,
      Ramsey. Everything's all split up, and she might happen not to be in a
      single of your classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know my luck!&rdquo; the afflicted boy protested. &ldquo;I wish I'd gone to
      Harvard, the way my father wanted me to. Why, this is just the worst
      nuisance I ever struck! You'll see! She'll be in everything there is, just
      the way she was back home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to be corroborated by the events of the next day, when they
      attended the first meeting to organize the new class. The masculine
      element predominated, but Dora Yocum was elected vice-president. &ldquo;You
      see?&rdquo; Ramsey said. &ldquo;Didn't I tell you? You see what happens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But after that she ceased for a time to intrude upon his life, and he
      admitted that his harassment was less grave than he had anticipated. There
      were about five hundred students in the freshman class; he seldom saw her,
      and when he did it was not more than a distant glimpse of her on one of
      the campus paths, her thoughtful head bent over a book as she hurried to a
      classroom. This was bearable; and in the flattering agitations of being
      sought, and even hunted, by several &ldquo;fraternities&rdquo; simultaneously desirous
      of his becoming a sworn Brother, he almost forgot her. After a hazardous
      month the roommates fell into the arms of the last &ldquo;frat&rdquo; to seek them,
      and having undergone an evening of outrage which concluded with touching
      rhetoric and an oath taken at midnight, they proudly wore jewelled symbols
      on their breasts and were free to turn part of their attention to other
      affairs, especially the affairs of the Eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, they were instructed by the older brethren of their Order, whose
      duty it was to assist in the proper manoeuvring of their young careers,
      that, although support of the 'varsity teams was important, they must
      neglect neither the spiritual nor the intellectual by-products of
      undergraduate doings. Therefore they became members of the college
      Y.M.C.A. and of the &ldquo;Lumen Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      According to the charter which it had granted itself, the &ldquo;Lumen Society&rdquo;
       was an &ldquo;Organization of male and female students&rdquo;&mdash;so &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; was
      this university&mdash;&ldquo;for the development of the powers of debate and
      oratory, intellectual and sociological progress, and the discussion of all
      matters relating to philosophy, metaphysics, literature, art, and current
      events.&rdquo; A statement so formidable was not without a hushing effect upon
      Messrs. Milholland and Mitchell; they went to their first &ldquo;Lumen&rdquo; meeting
      in a state of fear and came away little reassured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't get up there,&rdquo; Ramsey declared, &ldquo;I couldn't stand up there
      before all that crowd and make a speech, or debate in a debate, to save my
      soul and gizzard! Why, I'd just keel right over and haf to be carried
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the way I understand it,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;we can't get out of it. The
      seniors in the 'frat' said we had to join, and they said we couldn't
      resign, either, after we had joined. They said we just had to go through
      it, and after a while we'd get used to it and not mind it much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> will!&rdquo; Ramsey insisted. &ldquo;I couldn't any more stand up there on
      my feet and get to spoutin' about sociology and the radical metempsychorus
      of the metaphysical bazoozum than I could fly a flyin' machine. Why, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that wasn't anything,&rdquo; Fred interrupted. &ldquo;The only one that talked
      like that, he was that Blickens; he's a tutor, or something, and really a
      member of the faculty. Most o' the others just kind of blah-blahhed
      around, and what any of 'em tried to get off their chests hardly amounted
      to terribly much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care. I couldn't do it at <i>all!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the way it looks to me,&rdquo; Fred observed, &ldquo;we simply <i>got</i> to!
      From what they tell me, the freshmen got to do more than anybody. Every
      other Friday night, it's all freshmen and nothin' else. You get a postal
      card on Monday morning in your mail, and it says 'Assignment' on it, and
      then it's got written underneath what you haf to do the next Friday night&mdash;oration
      or debate, or maybe just read from some old book or something. I guess we
      got to stand up there and <i>try</i>, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;If they want me to commit suicide they can send
      me one o' their ole 'Assignments.' I won't need to commit suicide, though,
      I guess. All I'll do, I'll just fall over in a fit, and stay in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in truth, when he received his first &ldquo;Assignment,&rdquo; one Monday
      morning, a month later, he seemed in a fair way to fulfil his prophecy.
      The attention of his roommate, who sat at a window of their study, was
      attracted by sounds of strangulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth's the matter, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! Look at <i>this!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred took the card and examined it with an amazement gradually merging
      into a pleasure altogether too perceptible:
    </p>
    <p>
      ASSIGNMENT
    </p>
    <p>
      TWELVE-MINUTE DEBATE, CLASS OF 1918. <i>Subject, Resolved:</i> That
      Germany is both legally and morally justified in her invasion of Belgium.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Debaters are notified that each will be held strictly to the following
      schedule: Affirmative, 4 min., first. Negative, 4 min., first. Affirm, 2
      min., second. Neg., 2 min., second.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Affirmative Negative R. MILHOLLAND, '18 D. YOCUM, '18
    </p>
    <p>
      Concluding his reading, which was oral, the volatile Mitchell made use of
      his voice in a manner of heathenish boisterousness, and presently reclined
      upon a lounge to laugh the better. His stricken comrade, meanwhile,
      recovered so far as to pace the floor. &ldquo;I'm goin' to pack up and light out
      for home!&rdquo; he declared, over and over. And even oftener he read and reread
      the card to make sure of the actuality of that fatal coincidence, &ldquo;D.
      Yocum, '18.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;If I <i>could</i> do it,&rdquo; he vociferated, &ldquo;if I <i>could</i> stand up
      there and debate one o' their darn ole debates in the first place&mdash;if
      I had the gall to even try it, why, my gosh! you don't suppose I'm goin'
      to get up there and argue with <i>that girl</i>, do you? That's a hot way
      to get an education: stand up there and argue with a girl before a couple
      o' hundred people! My <i>gosh!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got to!&rdquo; his prostrate companion cackled, weakly. &ldquo;You can't get out
      of it. You're a goner, ole Buddy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be sick. I'll be sick as a dog! I'll be sick as the sickest dog that
      ever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use, ole man. The frat seniors'll be on the job. They'll know whether
      you're sick or not, and they'll have you there, right on the spot to the
      minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prediction was accurate. The too fatherly &ldquo;frat seniors&rdquo; did all that
      Fred said they would, and more. For the honour of the &ldquo;frat,&rdquo; they coached
      the desperate Ramsey in the technic of Lumen debate, told him many more
      things to say than could be said in six minutes, and produced him,
      despairing, ghastly, and bedewed, in the large hall of the Lumen Society
      at eight o'clock on Friday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four other &ldquo;twelve-minute debates&rdquo; preceded his and the sound of these, in
      Ramsey's ears, was the sound of Gabriel practising on his horn in the
      early morning of Judgment Day. The members of the society sat, three rows
      deep, along the walls of the room, leaving a clear oblong of green carpet
      in the centre, where were two small desks, twenty feet apart, the rostrums
      of the debaters. Upon a platform at the head of the room sat dreadful
      seniors, the officers of the society, and, upon benches near the platform,
      the debaters of the evening were aligned. One of the fraternal seniors sat
      with sweltering Ramsey; and the latter, as his time relentlessly came
      nearer, made a last miserable squirm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Brother Colburn, I got to get out o' here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don't, young fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo; Ramsey whispered, passionately. &ldquo;Honest, I do. Honest,
      Brother Colburn, I got to get a drink of water. I <i>got</i> to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest, Colburn, I <i>got</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey grunted feebly, and cast his dilating eyes along the rows of faces.
      Most of them were but as blurs, swimming, yet he was aware (he thought) of
      a formidable and horrible impassive scrutiny of himself, a glare seeming
      to pierce through him to the back of the belt round his waist, so that he
      began to have fearful doubts about that belt, about every fastening and
      adjustment of his garments, about the expression of his countenance, and
      about many other things jumbling together in his consciousness. Over and
      over he whispered gaspingly to himself the opening words of the sentence
      with which Colburn had advised him to begin his argument. And as the
      moment of supreme agony drew close, this whispering became continuous: &ldquo;In
      making my first appearance before this honor'ble membership I feel
      constrained to say in making my first appearance before this honor'ble
      membership I feel constrained to say in making my first appearance before
      this honor'ble mem&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      ...It had come. The chairman announced the subject of the fourth freshman
      twelve-minute debate; and Dora Yocum, hitherto unperceived by Ramsey, rose
      and went forward to one of the small desks in the open space, where she
      stood composedly, a slim, pretty figure in white. Members in Ramsey's
      neighbourhood were aware of a brief and hushed commotion, and of Colburn's
      fierce whisper, &ldquo;You can't! You get up there!&rdquo; And the blanched Ramsey
      came forth and placed himself at the other desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood before the silent populace of that morgue, and it seemed to him
      that his features had forgotten that he was supposed to be their owner and
      in control of them; he felt that they were slipping all over his face,
      regardless of his wishes. His head, as a whole, was subject to an
      agitation not before known by him; it desired to move rustily in eccentric
      ways of its own devising; his legs alternately limbered and straightened
      under no direction but their own; and his hands clutched each other
      fiercely behind his back; he was not one cohesive person, evidently, but
      an assembled collection of parts which had relapsed each into its own
      individuality. In spite of them, he somehow contrived the semblance of a
      bow toward the chairman and the semblance of another toward Dora, of whom
      he was but hazily conscious. Then he opened his mouth, and, not knowing
      how he had started his voice going, heard it as if from a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In making my first appearance before this honor'ble membership I feel
      restrained to say&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short, and thenceforward shook
      visibly. After a long pause, he managed to repeat his opening, stopped
      again, swallowed many times, produced a handkerchief and wiped his face,
      an act of necessity&mdash;then had an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The subject assigned to me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is resolved that Germany is mor'ly
      and legally justified in Belgians&mdash;Belgiums! This subject was
      assigned to me to be the subject of this debate.&rdquo; He interrupted himself
      to gasp piteously; found breathing difficult, but faltered again: &ldquo;This
      subject is the subject. It is the subject that was assigned to me on a
      postal card.&rdquo; Then, for a moment or so, he had a miraculous spurt of
      confidence, and continued rather rapidly: &ldquo;I feel constrained to say that
      the country of Belgian&mdash;Belgium, I mean&mdash;this country has been
      constrained by the&mdash;invaded I mean&mdash;invaded by the imperial
      German Impire and my subject in this debate is whether it ought to or not,
      my being the infernative&mdash;affirmative, I mean&mdash;that I got to
      prove that Germany is mor'ly and legally justified. I wish to state that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused again, lengthily, then struggled on. &ldquo;I have been requested to
      state that the German Imp&mdash;Empire&mdash;that it certainly isn't right
      for those Dutch&mdash;Germans, I mean&mdash;they haven't got any more
      business in Belgium than I have myself, but I&mdash;I feel constrained to
      say that I had to accept whatever side of this debate I got on the postal
      card, and so I am constrained to take the side of the Dutch. I mean the
      Germans. The Dutch are sometimes called&mdash;I mean the Germans are
      sometimes called the Dutch in this country, but they aren't Dutch, though
      sometimes called Dutch in this country. Well, and so&mdash;so, well, the
      war began last August or about then, anyway, and the German army invaded
      the Belgian army. After they got there, the invasion began. First, they
      came around there and then they commenced invading. Well, what I feel
      constrained&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came to the longest of all his pauses here, and the awful gravity of
      the audience almost suffocated him. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;it don't look
      right to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four minutes!&rdquo; the chairman announced, for Ramsey's pauses had worn away
      a great deal more of this terrible interval than had his eloquence.
      &ldquo;Opening statement for the negative: Miss D. Yocum. Four minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Dora began to speak, Ramsey experienced a little relief, but only a
      little&mdash;about the same amount of relief as that felt by a bridegroom
      when it is the bride's turn to &ldquo;respond,&rdquo; not really relief at all, but
      merely the slight relaxation of a continuing strain. The audience now
      looked at Ramsey no more than people look at a bridegroom, but he failed
      to perceive any substantial mitigation of his frightful conspicuousness.
      He had not the remotest idea of what he had said in setting forth his case
      for Germany, and he knew that it was his duty to listen closely to Dora,
      in order to be able to refute her argument when his two-minute closing
      speech fell due but he was conscious of little more than his own
      condition. His legs had now gone wild beyond all devilry, and he had to
      keep shifting his weight from one to the other in order even to hope that
      their frenzy might escape general attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized that Dora was speaking rapidly and confidently, and that
      somewhere in his ill-assembled parts lurked a familiar bit of him that
      objected to her even more than usual; but she had used half of her time,
      at least, before he was able to gather any coherent meaning from what she
      was saying. Even then he caught only a fragment, here and there, and for
      the rest&mdash;so far as Ramsey was concerned&mdash;she might as well have
      been reciting the Swedish alphabet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the rather startling feebleness of her opponent's statement,
      Dora went at her task as earnestly as if it were to confute some monster
      of casuistry. &ldquo;Thus, having demonstrated that <i>all</i> war is wrong,&rdquo;
       she said, approaching her conclusion, &ldquo;it is scarcely necessary to point
      out that whatever the actual circumstances of the invasion, and whatever
      the status of the case in international law, or by reason of treaty, or
      the German oath to respect the neutrality of Belgium, which of course was
      grossly and dishonorably violated&mdash;all this, I say, ladies and
      gentlemen of the Lumen Society, all this is beside the point of morals.
      Since, as I have shown, <i>all</i> war is wrong, the case may be
      simplified as follows: All war is morally wrong. <i>Quod erat
      demonstrandum</i>. Germany invaded Belgium. Invasion is war. Germany,
      therefore, did moral wrong. Upon the legal side, as I began by pointing
      out, Germany confessed in the Reichstag the violation of law. Therefore,
      Germany was justified in the invasion neither morally nor legally; but was
      both morally and legally wrong and evil. Ladies and gentlemen of the Lumen
      Society, I await the refutation of my opponent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her opponent appeared to be having enough trouble with his legs, without
      taking any added cares upon himself in the way of refutations. But the
      marvellous Dora had calculated the length of her statement with such
      nicety that the chairman announced &ldquo;Four minutes,&rdquo; almost upon the instant
      of her final syllable; and all faces turned once more to the upholder of
      the affirmative. &ldquo;Refutation and conclusion by the affirmative,&rdquo; said the
      chairman. &ldquo;Mr. R. Milholland. Two minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Therewith, Ramsey coughed as long as he could cough, and when he felt that
      no more should be done in this way, he wiped his face&mdash;again an act
      of necessity&mdash;and quaveringly began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen and ladies, or ladies and gentlemen, in making the refutation
      of my opponent, I feel that&mdash;I feel that hardly anything more ought
      to be said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, looked helplessly at his uncontrollable legs, and resumed: &ldquo;I
      am supposed to make the reputa&mdash;the refutation of my opponent, and I
      feel that I ought to say quite a good deal more. In the first place, I
      feel that the invasion has taken place. I am supposed&mdash;anyhow I got a
      postal card that I am supposed to be here to-night. Well, in talking over
      this matter with a couple of seniors, they told me I was supposed to claim
      this invasion was mor'ly and legally all right. Well&mdash;&rdquo; Here, by some
      chance, the recollection of a word of Dora's flickered into his chaotic
      mind, and he had a brighter moment. &ldquo;My opponent said she proved all war
      is wrong&mdash;or something like that, anyhow. She said she proved it was
      wrong to fight, no matter what. Well, if she wasn't a girl, anybody that
      wanted to get her into a fight could prob'ly do it.&rdquo; He did not add that
      he would like to be the person to make the experiment (if Dora weren't a
      girl), nor did the thought enter his mind until an hour or so later.
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I suppose there is little more to be said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was so right, in regard to his own performance, at least, that,
      thereupon drying up utterly, he proceeded to stand, a speechless figure in
      the midst of a multitudinous silence, for an eternity lasting forty-five
      seconds. He made a racking effort, and at the end of this epoch found
      words again. &ldquo;In making my argument in this debate, I would state that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two minutes!&rdquo; said the chairman. &ldquo;Refutation by the negative. Miss D.
      Yocum. Two minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waive them,&rdquo; said Dora, primly. &ldquo;I submit that the affirmative has not
      refuted the argument of the negative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; With his gavel the chairman sharply tapped the desk before
      him, &ldquo;The question is now before the house. 'Resolved, that Germany is
      both morally and legally justified in her invasion of Belgium.' All those
      in favour of the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here there was an interruption of a kind never before witnessed during
      any proceedings of the Lumen Society. It came from neither of the
      debaters, who still remained standing at their desks until the vote
      settling their comparative merits in argument should be taken. The
      interruption was from the rear row of seats along the wall, where sat new
      members of the society, freshmen not upon the program for the evening. A
      loud voice was heard from this quarter, a loud but nasal voice, shrill as
      well as nasal, and full of a strange hot passion. &ldquo;Mr. Chairman!&rdquo; it
      cried. &ldquo;Look-a-here, Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman, I demand to be heard! You
      gotta gimme my say, Mr. Chairman! I'm a-gunna have my <i>say</i>! You
      look-a-here, Mr. Chairman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shocked by such a breach of order, and by the unseemly violence of the
      speaker, not only the chairman but everyone else looked there. A short,
      strong figure was on its feet, gesticulating fiercely; and the head
      belonging to it was a large one with too much curly black hair, a flat,
      swarthy face, shiny and not immaculately shaven; there was an impression
      of ill-chosen clothes, too much fat red lip, too much tooth, too much
      eyeball. Fred Mitchell, half-sorrowing, yet struggling to conceal tears of
      choked mirth over his roommate's late exhibition, recognized this violent
      interrupter as one Linski, a fellow freshman who sat next to him in one of
      his classes. &ldquo;What's <i>that</i> cuss up to?&rdquo; Fred wondered, and so did
      others. Linski showed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed forward, shoving himself through the two rows in front of him
      till he emerged upon the green carpet of the open space, and as he came,
      he was cyclonic with words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't put no such stuff as this over, I tell you!&rdquo; he shouted in his
      hot, nasal voice. &ldquo;This here's a free country, and you call yourself a
      debating society, do you? Lemme tell you <i>I</i> belong to a debating
      society in Chicago, where I come from, and them fellas up there, they'd
      think they'd oughta be shot fer a fake like what you people are tryin' to
      put over, here, to-night. I come down here to git some more education, and
      pay fer it, too, in good hard money I've made sweatin' in a machine shop
      up there in Chicago; but if <i>this</i> is the kind of education I'm
      a-gunna git, I better go on back there. You call this a square debate, do
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He advanced toward the chairman's platform, shaking a frantic fist. &ldquo;Well,
      if you do, you got another think comin', my capitalis' frien'! you went
      and give out the question whether it's right fer Choimuny to go through
      Belgium; and what do you do fer the Choimun side? You pick out this here
      big stiff&rdquo;&mdash;he waved his passionate hand at the paralyzed Ramsey&mdash;&ldquo;you
      pick out a boob like that for the Choimun side, a poor fish that gits
      stagefright so bad he don't know whether he's talkin' or dead; or else he
      fakes it; because he's a speaker so bum it looks more to me like he was
      faking. You get this big stiff to fake the Choimun side, and then you go
      and stick up a goil agains' him that's got brains and makes a pacifis'
      argument that wins the case agains' the Choimuns like cuttin' through hog
      lard! But you ain't a-gunna git away with it, mister! Lemme tell you right
      here and now, I may be a mix blood, but I got some Choimun in me with the
      rest what I got, and before you vote on this here question you gotta hear
      a few woids from somebody that can <i>talk!</i> This whole war is a
      capitalis' war, Belgium as much as Choimuny, and the United States is
      sellin' its soul to the capitalis' right now, I tell you, takin' sides
      agains' Choimuny. Orders fer explosives and ammanition and guns and Red
      Cross supplies is comin' into this country by the millions, and the
      capitalis' United States is fat already on the blood of the workers of
      Europe! Yes, it is, and I'll have my <i>say,</i> you boorjaw faker, and
      you can hammer your ole gavel to pieces at me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to shriek; moisture fell from his brow and his mouth; the
      scandalized society was on its feet, nervously into groups. Evidently the
      meeting was about to disintegrate. &ldquo;I'll have my <i>say</i>!&rdquo; the frenzied
      Linski screamed. &ldquo;You try to put up this capitalis' trick and work a fake
      to carry over this debate agains' Choimuny, but you can't work it on <i>me</i>,
      lemme tell you! I'll have my <i>say!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The outraged chairman was wholly at a loss how to deal with the
      &ldquo;unprecedented situation&rdquo;&mdash;so he defined it, quite truthfully; and he
      continued to pound upon the desk, while other clamours began to rival
      Linski's; shouts of &ldquo;Put him out!&rdquo; &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; &ldquo;Shut up, Freshman!&rdquo; &ldquo;Turn him
      over to the sophomores!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This meeting is <i>adjourned!</i>&rdquo; bellowed the chairman, and there was a
      thronging toward the doors, while the frothing Linski asseverated: &ldquo;I'm
      a-gunna git my say, I tell you! I'll have my say! I'll have my <i>say!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had more than that, before the hour was over. A moment after he emerged
      from the building and came out, still hot, upon the cool, dark campus, he
      found himself the centre of a group of his own classmates whom he at first
      mistook for sophomores, such was their manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      ...As this group broke up, a few minutes later, a youth running to join
      it, scenting somewhat of interest, detained one of those who were
      departing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up? What was that squealing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. We just talked to that Linski. Nobody else touched him, but
      Ramsey Milholland gave him a <i>peach</i> of a punch on the snoot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoopee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey was laconic in response to inquiries upon this subject. When
      someone remarked: &ldquo;You served him right for calling you a boob and a poor
      fish and so on before all the society, girls and all,&rdquo; Ramsey only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn't what I hit him for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He declined to explain further.

    <h2>
      Chapter XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way I look at it, Ramsey,&rdquo; Fred Mitchell said, when they reached
      their apartment, whither the benevolent Colburn accompanied them, &ldquo;the way
      I look at it, this Linski kind of paid you a compliment, after all, when
      he called you a fake. He must have thought you anyway <i>looked</i> as if
      you could make a better speech than you did. Oh, golly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as Ramsey groaned, the jovial Mitchell gave himself up to the divan
      and the mirth. &ldquo;Oh, oh, oh, <i>golly</i>!&rdquo; he sputtered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind, Brother Milholland,&rdquo; Colburn said gently. &ldquo;The Lumen is
      used to nervous beginners. I've seen dozens in my time, just like you; and
      some of 'em got to be first rate before they quit. Besides, this crazy
      Linski is all that anybody'll ever remember about to-night's meeting,
      anyhow. There never was any such outbreak as that in <i>my</i> time, and I
      guess there never was in the whole history of the society. We'll probably
      suspend him until he apologizes to the society&mdash;I'm on the board, and
      I'm in favour of it. Who is the bird, anyhow? He's in your class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw him before,&rdquo; Ramsey responded from the deep chair, where he
      had moodily thrown himself; and, returning to his brooding upon his
      oratory. &ldquo;Oh, murder!&rdquo; he moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the senior, &ldquo;you'll know him when you see him again. You put
      your mark on him where you can see it, all right!&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;I suppose
      I really ought to have interfered in that, but I decided to do a little
      astronomical observation, about fifty feet away, for a few minutes. I'm
      'way behind in my astronomy, anyhow. Do you know this Linski, Brother
      Mitchell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've talked to him a couple o' times on the campus,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;He's in
      one of my classes. He's about the oldest in our class, I guess&mdash;a lot
      older than us, anyhow. He's kind of an anarchist or something; can't talk
      more'n five minutes any time without gettin off some bug stuff about
      'capitalism.' He said the course in political economy was all 'capitalism'
      and the prof was bought by Wall Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Prof. Craig!&rdquo; Colburn laughed. &ldquo;He gets fifteen hundred a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I'd heard that myself, and I told Linski, and he said he had an
      uncle workin' in a steel mill got twice that much; but it didn't make any
      difference, ole Craig was bought by Wall Street. He said 'capitalism'
      better look out; he and the foreign-born workmen were goin' to <i>take</i>
      this country some day, and that was one of the reasons he was after an
      education. He talked pretty strong pro-German, too&mdash;about the war in
      Europe&mdash;but I sort of thought that was more because he'd be
      pro-anything that he thought would help upset the United States than
      because he cared much about Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Colburn, &ldquo;that's how he sounded to-night. I guess there's
      plenty more like him in the cities, too. That reminds me, I'd better
      arrange a debate on immigration for the Lumen. We'll put Brother
      Milholland for the negative, this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey started violently. &ldquo;See here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the senior reassured him. &ldquo;Just wanted to see you jump,&rdquo; he explained.
      &ldquo;Don't fear; you've done your share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think I have!&rdquo; Ramsey groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you won't be called on again this term. By the way,&rdquo; said Colburn,
      thoughtfully, &ldquo;that was a clever girl you had against you to-night. I
      don't believe in pacificism much, myself, but she used it very niftily for
      her argument. Isn't she from your town, this Miss Yocum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she's a clever young thing,&rdquo; said the senior, still thoughtful. And
      he added: &ldquo;Graceful girl, she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this, the roommates looked at him with startled attention. Ramsey was
      so roused as to forget his troubles and sit forward in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the musing Colburn, &ldquo;she's a mighty pretty girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation was a simultaneous one; the astounded pair stared at him
      in blank incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don't you think so?&rdquo; Colburn mildly inquired. &ldquo;She seems to me very
      unusual looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; Fred assented, emphatically. &ldquo;We're with you there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary eyes,&rdquo; continued Colburn. &ldquo;Lovely figure, too; altogether a
      strikingly pretty girl. Handsome, I should say, perhaps. Yes, 'handsome'
      rather than 'pretty'.&rdquo; He looked up from a brief reverie. &ldquo;You fellows
      known her long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; said Ramsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She made a splendid impression on the Lumen,&rdquo; Colburn went on. &ldquo;I don't
      remember that I ever saw a first appearance there that quite equalled it.
      She'll probably have a brilliant career in the society, and in the
      university, too. She must be a very fine sort of person.&rdquo; He deliberated
      within himself a few moments longer, then, realizing that his hosts and
      Brethren did not respond with any heartiness&mdash;or with anything at all&mdash;to
      the theme, he changed it, and asked them what they thought about the war
      in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked of the war rather drowsily for a while; it was an interesting
      but not an exciting topic: the thing they spoke of was so far away. It was
      in foreign countries where they had never been and had no acquaintances;
      and both the cause and the issue seemed to be in confusion, though
      evidently Germany had &ldquo;started&rdquo; the trouble. Only one thing emerged as
      absolutely clear and proved: there could be no disagreement about
      Germany's &ldquo;dirty work,&rdquo; as Fred defined it, in violating Belgium. And this
      stirred Ramsey to declare with justice that &ldquo;dirty work&rdquo; had likewise been
      done upon himself by the official person, whoever he or she was, who had
      given him the German side of the evening's debate. After this moment of
      fervour, the conversation languished, and Brother Colburn rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad you gave that Linski a fine little punch, Brother
      Milholland,&rdquo; he said, at the door. &ldquo;It won't do you any harm in the
      'frat,' or with the Lumen either. And don't be discouraged about your
      debating. You'll learn. Anybody might have got rattled by having to argue
      against as clever and good-looking a girl as that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The roommates gave each other a look of serious puzzlement as the door
      closed. &ldquo;Well, Brother Colburn is a mighty nice fellow,&rdquo; Fred said. &ldquo;He's
      kind of funny, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey assented, and then, as the two prepared for bed, they entered into
      a further discussion of their senior friend. They liked him &ldquo;all right,&rdquo;
       they said, but he certainly must be kind of queer, and they couldn't just
      see how he had &ldquo;ever managed to get where he was&rdquo; in the &ldquo;frat&rdquo; and the
      Lumen and the university.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ramsey passed the slightly disfigured Linski on the campus next day
      without betraying any embarrassment or making a sign of recognition. Fred
      Mitchell told his roommate, chuckling, that Linski had sworn to &ldquo;get&rdquo; him,
      and, not knowing Fred's affiliations, had made him the confidant of his
      oath. Fred had given his blessing, he said, upon the enterprise, and
      advised Linski to use a brick. &ldquo;He'll hit you on the head with it,&rdquo; said
      the light-hearted Fred, falling back upon this old joke. &ldquo;Then you can
      catch it as it bounces off and throw it back at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, Linski proved to be merely an episode, not only so far as Ramsey
      was concerned but in the Lumen and in the university as well. His
      suspension from the Lumen was for a year, and so cruel a punishment it
      proved for this born debater that he noisily declared he would found a
      debating society himself, and had a poster printed and distributed
      announcing the first meeting of &ldquo;The Free Speech and Masses' Rights
      Council.&rdquo; Several town loafers attended the meeting, but the only person
      connected with the university who came was an oriental student, a Chinese
      youth of almost intrusive amiability. Linski made a fiery address, the
      townsmen loudly appluading his advocacy of an embargo on munitions and the
      distribution of everybody's &ldquo;property,&rdquo; but the Chinaman, accustomed to
      see students so madly in earnest only when they were burlesquing, took the
      whole affair to be intended humour, and tittered politely without
      cessation&mdash;except at such times as he thought it proper to appear
      quite wrung with laughter. Then he would rock himself, clasp his mouth
      with both hands and splutter through his fingers. Linski accused him of
      being in the pay of &ldquo;capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day the orator was unable to show himself upon the campus without
      causing demonstrations; whenever he was seen a file of quickly gathering
      students marched behind him chanting repeatedly and deafeningly in chorus:
      &ldquo;Down with Wall Street! Hoch der Kaiser! Who loves Linski? Who, who, who?
      Hoo Lun! Who loves Linski? Who, who, who? Hoo Lun!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Linski was disgusted, resigned from the university, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here it isn't mid-year Exams yet, and the good ole class of
      Nineteen-Eighteen's already lost a member,&rdquo; said Fred Mitchell. &ldquo;I guess
      we can bear the break-up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Ramsey assented. &ldquo;That Linski might just as well stayed
      here, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn't do any harm here. He'll prob'ly get more people to listen to
      him in cities where there's so many new immigrants and all such that don't
      know anything, comin' in all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;What do <i>we</i> care what happens to Chicago!
      Come on, let's behave real wild, and go on over to the 'Teria and get us a
      couple egg sandwiches and sassprilly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey was willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the strain of the &ldquo;mid-year Exams&rdquo; in February, they lived a
      free-hearted life. They had settled into the ways of their world; they had
      grown used to it, and it had grown used to them; there was no longer any
      ignominy in being a freshman. They romped upon the campus and sometimes
      rioted harmlessly about the streets of the town. In the evenings they
      visited their fellows and Brethren and were visited in turn, and sometimes
      they looked so far ahead as to talk vaguely of their plans for professions
      or business&mdash;though to a freshman this concerned an almost
      unthinkably distant prospect. &ldquo;I guess I'll go in with my father, in the
      wholesale drug business,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;My married brother already is in the
      firm, and I suppose they'll give me a show&mdash;send me out on the road a
      year or two first, maybe, to try me. Then I'm going to marry some little
      cutie and settle down. What you goin' to do, Ramsey? Go to Law School, and
      then come back and go in your father's office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Guess so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was always Fred who did most of the talking; Ramsey was quiet. Fred
      told the &ldquo;frat seniors&rdquo; that Ramsey was &ldquo;developing a whole lot these
      days&rdquo;; and he told Ramsey himself that he could see a &ldquo;big change&rdquo; in him,
      adding that the improvement was probably due to Ramsey's having passed
      through &ldquo;terrible trials like that debate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey kept to their rooms more than his comrade did, one reason for this
      domesticity being that he &ldquo;had to study longer than Fred did, to keep up&rdquo;;
      and another reason may have been a greater shyness than Fred possessed&mdash;if,
      indeed, Fred possessed any shyness at all. For Fred was a cheery spirit
      difficult to abash, and by the coming of spring knew all of the
      best-looking girl students in the place&mdash;knew them well enough, it
      appeared, to speak of them not merely by their first names but by
      abbreviations of these. He had become fashion's sprig, a &ldquo;fusser&rdquo; and
      butterfly, and he reproached his roommate for shunning the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the truth is, Fred,&rdquo; said Ramsey one day, responding darkly;&mdash;&ldquo;well,
      you see the truth is, Fred, I've had a&mdash;a&mdash;I've had an
      experience&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, only, did he refer to Milla.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred said no more; and it was comprehended between them that the past need
      never be definitely referred to again, but that it stood between Ramsey
      and any entertainment to be obtained of the gentler but less trustworthy
      sex. And when other Brethren of the &ldquo;frat&rdquo; would have pressed Ramsey to
      join them in various frivolous enterprises concerning &ldquo;co-eds,&rdquo; or to be
      shared by &ldquo;co-eds,&rdquo; Fred thought it better to explain to them privately
      (all being sacred among Brethren) how Ramsey's life, so far as Girls went,
      had been toyed with by one now a Married Woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This created a great deal of respect for Ramsey. It became understood
      everywhere that he was a woman-hater.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      That early spring of 1915 the two boys and their friends and Brethren
      talked more of the war than they had in the autumn, though the subject was
      not an all at absorbing one; for the trenches in Flanders and France were
      still of the immense, remote distance. By no stretch of imagination could
      these wet trenches be thought greatly to concern the &ldquo;frat,&rdquo; the Lumen, or
      the university. Really important matters were the doings of the &ldquo;Track
      Team,&rdquo; now training in the &ldquo;Gym&rdquo; and on the 'Varsity Field, and, more
      vital still, the prospects of the Nine. But in May there came a shock
      which changed things for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Lusitania</i> brought to every American a revelation of what had
      lain so deep in his own heart that often he had not realized it was there.
      When the Germans hid in the sea and sent down the great merchant ship,
      with American babies and their mothers, and gallantly dying American
      gentlemen, there came a change even to girls and boys and professors,
      until then so preoccupied with their own little aloof world thousands of
      miles from the murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred Mitchell, ever volatile and generous, was one of those who went quite
      wild. No orator, he nevertheless made a frantic speech at the week's &ldquo;frat
      meetings,&rdquo; cursing the Germans in the simple old English words that their
      performance had demonstrated to be applicable, and going on to demand that
      the fraternity prepare for its own share in the action of the country. &ldquo;I
      don't care <i>how</i> insignificant we few fellows here to-night may
      seem,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;we can do our little, and if everybody in this country's
      ready to do their own little, why, that'll be plenty! Brothers, don't you
      realize that all <i>over</i> the United States to-night the people are
      feeling just the way we are here? Millions and millions and millions of
      them! Wherever there's an American he's <i>with</i> us&mdash;and you bet
      your bottom dollar there are just a few more Americans in this country of
      ours than there are big-mouthed lobsters like that fellow Linski! I tell
      you, if Congress only gives the word, there could be an army of five
      million men in this country to-morrow, and those dirty baby-killin'
      dachshunds would hear a word or two from your Uncle Samuel! Brothers, I
      demand that something be done right here and now, and by us! I move we
      telegraph the Secretary of War to-night and offer him a regiment from this
      university to go over and help <i>hang</i> their damn Kaiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The motion was hotly seconded and instantly carried. Then followed a much
      flustered discussion of the form and phrasing of the proposed telegram,
      but, after everything seemed to have been settled, someone ascertained by
      telephone that the telegraph company would not accept messages containing
      words customarily defined as profane; so the telegram had to be rewritten.
      This led to further amendment, and it was finally decided to address the
      senators from that state, instead of the Secretary of War, and thus in a
      somewhat modified form the message was finally despatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, news of what the &ldquo;frat&rdquo; had done made a great stir in the
      university; other &ldquo;frats&rdquo; sent telegrams, so did the &ldquo;Barbarians,&rdquo; haters
      of the &ldquo;frats&rdquo; but joining them in this; while a small band of
      &ldquo;German-American&rdquo; students found it their duty to go before the faculty
      and report these &ldquo;breaches of neutrality.&rdquo; They protested heavily,
      demanding the expulsion of the &ldquo;breachers&rdquo; as disloyal citizens, therefore
      unfit students, but suffered a disappointment; for the faculty itself had
      been sending telegrams of similar spirit, addressing not only the senators
      and congressmen of the state but the President of the United States.
      Flabbergasted, the &ldquo;German-Americans&rdquo; retired; they were confused and
      disgusted by this higher-up outbreak of unneutrality&mdash;it overwhelmed
      them that citizens of the United States should not remain neutral in the
      dispute between the United States and Germany. All day the campus was in
      ferment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twilight, Ramsey was walking meditatively on his way to dinner at the
      &ldquo;frat house,&rdquo; across the campus from his apartment at Mrs. Meig's.
      Everybody was quiet now, both town and gown; the students were at their
      dinners and so were the burghers. Ramsey was late but did not quicken his
      thoughtful steps, which were those of one lost in reverie. He had
      forgotten that spring-time was all about him, and, with his head down,
      walked unregardful of the new gayeties flung forth upon the air by great
      clusters of flowering shrubs, just come into white blossom and lavender.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unconscious that somebody behind him, going the same way, came
      hastening to overtake him and called his name, &ldquo;Ramsey! Ramsey
      Milholland!&rdquo; Not until he had been called three times did he realize that
      he was being hailed&mdash;and in a girl's voice! By that time, the girl
      herself was beside him, and Ramsey halted, quite taken aback. The girl was
      Dora Yocum.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pale, a little breathless, and her eyes were bright and severe. &ldquo;I
      want to speak to you,&rdquo; she said, quickly. &ldquo;I want to ask you about
      something. Mr. Colburn and Fred Mitchell are the only people I know in
      your 'frat' except you, and I haven't seen either of them to-day, or I'd
      have asked one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Most uncomfortably astonished, Ramsey took his hands out of his pockets,
      picked a leaf from a lilac bush beside the path, and put the stem of the
      leaf seriously into a corner of his mouth, before finding anything to say.
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well, all right,&rdquo; he finally responded. &ldquo;I'll tell you&mdash;if
      it's anything I know about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know about it,&rdquo; said Dora. &ldquo;That is, you certainly do if you were at
      your 'frat' meeting last night. Were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was there,&rdquo; Ramsey answered, wondering what in the world she
      wanted to know, though he supposed vaguely that it must be something about
      Colburn, whom he had several times seen walking with her. &ldquo;Of course I
      couldn't tell you much,&rdquo; he added, with an afterthought. &ldquo;You see, a good
      deal that goes on at a 'frat' meeting isn't supposed to be talked about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, smiling faintly, though with a satire that missed him.
      &ldquo;I've been a member of a sorority since September, and I think I have an
      idea of what could be told or not told. Suppose we walk on, if you don't
      mind. My question needn't embarrass you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, as they slowly went on together, Ramsey was embarrassed. He
      felt &ldquo;queer.&rdquo; They had known each other so long; in a way had shared so
      much, sitting daily for years near each other and undergoing the same
      outward experiences; they had almost &ldquo;grown up together,&rdquo; yet this was the
      first time they had ever talked together or walked together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you want to ask anything it's all right for me
      to tell you&mdash;well, I just as soon, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has nothing to do with the secret proceedings of your 'frat',&rdquo; said
      Dora, primly. &ldquo;What I want to ask about has been talked of all over the
      place to-day. Everyone has been saying it was <i>your</i> 'frat' that sent
      the first telegram to members of the Government offering support in case
      of war with Germany. They say you didn't even wait until to-day, but sent
      off a message last night. What I wanted to ask you was whether this story
      is true or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Ramsey, mildly. &ldquo;That's what we did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered an exclamation, a sound of grief and of suspicion confirmed.
      &ldquo;Ah! I was afraid so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Afraid so'? What's the matter?&rdquo; he asked, and because she seemed excited
      and troubled, he found himself not quite so embarrassed as he had been at
      first; for some reason her agitation made him feel easier. &ldquo;What was wrong
      about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's all so shocking and wicked and mistaken!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Even the
      faculty has been doing it, and half the other 'frats' and sororities! And
      it was yours that started it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we did,&rdquo; he said, throughly puzzled. &ldquo;We're the oldest 'frat' here,
      and of course&rdquo;&mdash;he chuckled modestly&mdash;&ldquo;of course we think we're
      the best. Do you mean you believe we ought to've sat back and let somebody
      else start it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>no</i>!&rdquo; she answered, vehemently. &ldquo;Nobody ought to have started
      it! That's the trouble; don't you see? If nobody had started it none of it
      might have happened. The rest mightn't have caught it. It mightn't have
      got into their heads. A war thought is the most contagious thought in the
      world; but if it can be kept from starting, it can be kept from being
      contagious. It's just when people have got into an emotional state, or a
      state of smouldering rage, that everybody ought to be so terribly careful
      not to think war thoughts or make war speeches&mdash;or send war
      telegrams! I thought&mdash;oh, I was so sure I'd convinced Mr. Colburn of
      all this, the last time we talked of it! He seemed to understand, and I
      was sure he agreed with me.&rdquo; She bit her lip. &ldquo;He was only pretending&mdash;I
      see that now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he must 'a' been,&rdquo; said Ramsey, with admirable simplicity. &ldquo;He
      didn't talk about anything like that last night. He was as much for it as
      anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no doubt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey made bold to look at her out of the side of his eye, and as she was
      gazing tensely forward he continued his observation for some time. She was
      obviously controlling agitation, almost controlling tears, which seemed to
      threaten her very wide-open eyes; for those now fully grown and noticeable
      eyewinkers of hers were subject to fluctuations indicating such a threat.
      She looked &ldquo;hurt,&rdquo; and Ramsey was touched; there was something human about
      her, then, after all. And if he had put his feeling into words at the
      moment, he would have said that he guessed maybe he could stand this ole
      girl, for a few minutes sometimes, better than he'd always thought he
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Colburn prob'ly wouldn't want to hurt your feelings or
      anything. Colburn&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He? He didn't! I haven't the faintest personal interest in what he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;Well, excuse me; I thought prob'ly you were sore
      because he'd jollied you about this pacifist stuff, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said, sharply. &ldquo;I'm not thinking of his having agreed with <i>me</i>
      and fooling <i>me</i> about it. He just wanted to make a pleasant
      impression on a girl, and said anything he thought would please her. I
      don't care whether he does things like that or not. What I care about is
      that the <i>principle</i> didn't reach him and that he mocked it! I don't
      care about a petty treachery to me, personally, but I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fraternal loyalty could not quite brook this. &ldquo;Brother Colburn is a
      perfectly honor'ble man,&rdquo; said Ramsey, solemnly. &ldquo;He is one of the most
      honor'ble men in this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, can't I make you understand that I'm not
      condemning him for a little flattery to me? I don't care two straws for
      his showing that <i>I</i> didn't influence him. He doesn't interest me,
      please understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey was altogether perplexed. &ldquo;Well, I don't see what makes you go for
      him so hard, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you said he was treach&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't <i>condemn</i> him for it,&rdquo; she insisted, despairingly. &ldquo;Don't
      you see the difference? I'm not condemning anybody; I'm only lamenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About all of you that want <i>war</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My golly!&rdquo; Ramsey exclaimed. &ldquo;You don't think those Dutchmen were right
      to drown babies and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I think they were ghastly murderers! I think they were detestable and
      fiendish and monstrous and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, my goodness! What do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want war!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want Christianity!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I can't think of the Germans without
      hating them, and so to-day, when all the world is hating them, I keep
      myself from thinking of them as much as I can. Already half the world is
      full of war; you want to go to war to make things right, but it won't; it
      will only make more war!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see what you've done, you boys?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Don't you see what
      you've done with your absurd telegram? That started the rest; they thought
      they <i>all</i> had to send telegrams like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the faculty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even they mightn't have thought of it if it hadn't been for the first
      one. Vengeance is the most terrible thought; once you put it into people's
      minds that they ought to have it, it runs away with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn't mostly vengeance we're after, at all. There's a lot more
      to it than just getting even with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not heed him. &ldquo;You're all blind! You don't see what you're doing;
      you don't even see what you've done to this peaceful place here. You've
      filled it full of thoughts of fury and killing and massacre&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;It was those Dutch did that to us; and, besides,
      there's more to it than you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there isn't,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;It's just the old brutal spirit that
      nations inherit from the time they were only tribes; it's the tribe
      spirit, and an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. It's those things
      and the love of fighting&mdash;men have always loved to fight.
      Civilization hasn't taken it out of them; men still have the brute in them
      that loves to fight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;Americans don't love to fight; I don't
      know about other countries, but we don't. Of course, here and there,
      there's some fellow that likes to hunt around for scrapes, but I never saw
      more than three or four in my life that acted that way. Of course a
      football team often has a scrapper or two on it, but that's different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I think you all really love to fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey was roused to become argumentative. &ldquo;I don't see where you get the
      idea. Colburn isn't that way, and back at school there wasn't a single boy
      that was anything like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; She stopped, and turned suddenly to face him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he said, stopping, too. Something he said had
      startled her, evidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say such a thing?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;<i>You</i> love to fight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do! You love fighting. You always have loved fighting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was dumbfounded. &ldquo;Why, I never had a fight in my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She cried out in protest of such prevarication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never did,&rdquo; he insisted, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you had a fight about <i>me</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Wesley Bender!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey chuckled. &ldquo;<i>That</i> wasn't a fight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like one. We were just guyin' him about&mdash;about gettin'
      slicked up, kind of, because he sat in front of you; and he hit me with
      his book strap and I chased him off. Gracious, no; <i>that</i> wasn't a
      fight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you fought Linski only last fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey chuckled again. &ldquo;That wasn't even as much like a fight as the one
      with Wesley. I just told this Linski I was goin' to give him a punch in
      the sn&mdash; I just told him to look out because I was goin' to hit him,
      and then I did it, and waited to see if he wanted to do anything about it,
      and he didn't. That's all there was to it, and it wasn't any more like
      fighting than&mdash;than feeding chickens is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed dolefully. &ldquo;It seems to me rather more like it than that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it wasn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had begun to walk on again, and Ramsey was aware that they had passed
      the &ldquo;frat house,&rdquo; where his dinner was probably growing cold. He was aware
      of this, but not sharply or insistently. Curiously enough, he did not
      think about it. He had begun to find something pleasant in the odd
      interview, and in walking beside a girl, even though the girl was Dora
      Yocum. He made no attempt to account to himself for anything so peculiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while they went slowly together, not speaking, and without
      destination, though Ramsey vaguely took it for granted that Dora was going
      somewhere. But she wasn't. They emerged from the part of the small town
      closely built about the university and came out upon a bit of parked land
      overlooking the river; and here Dora's steps slowed to an indeterminate
      halt near a bench beneath a maple tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'll stay here a while,&rdquo; she said; and as he made no response,
      she asked, &ldquo;Hadn't you better be going back to your 'frat house' for your
      dinner? I didn't mean for you to come out of your way with me; I only
      wanted to get an answer to my question. You'd better be running back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood irresolute, not sure that he wanted his dinner just then. It
      would have amazed him to face the fact deliberately that perhaps he
      preferred being with Dora Yocum to eating. However, he faced no such fact,
      nor any fact, but lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I can get my dinner pretty near any time. I don't&mdash;&rdquo; He had
      a thought. &ldquo;Did you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have your dinner before I met you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, aren't you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I don't want any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think people have very much appetite to-day and yesterday,&rdquo; she
      said, with the hint of a sad laugh, &ldquo;all over America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I guess that's so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too terrible!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can't sit and eat when I think of the <i>Lusitania</i>&mdash;of
      all those poor, poor people strangling in the water&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I guess nobody can eat much, if they think about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of what it's going to bring, if we let it,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;As if this
      killing weren't enough, we want to add <i>our</i> killing! Oh, that's the
      most terrible thing of all&mdash;the thing it makes within us! Don't you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him appealingly, and he felt queerer than ever. Dusk had
      fallen. Where they stood, under the young-leaved maple tree, there was but
      a faint lingering of afterglow, and in this mystery her face glimmered wan
      and sweet; so that Ramsey, just then, was like one who discovers an old
      pan, used in the kitchen, to be made of chased silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't feel much like dinner right now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&mdash;we
      could sit here awhile on this bench, prob'ly.&rdquo;

      Chapter XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ramsey kept very few things from Fred Mitchell, and usually his
      confidences were immediate upon the occasion of them; but allowed several
      weeks to elapse before sketching for his roommate the outlines of this
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing that was kind o' funny about it, Fred,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I didn't know
      what to call her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mitchell, stretched upon the window seat in their &ldquo;study,&rdquo; and looking
      out over the town street below and the campus beyond the street, had
      already thought it tactful to ambush his profound amusement by turning
      upon his side, so that his face was toward the window and away from his
      companion. &ldquo;What did you want to call her?&rdquo; he inquired in a serious
      voice. &ldquo;Names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You know what I mean. I mean I had to just keep callin' her 'you';
      and that gets kind of freaky when you're talkin' to anybody a good while
      like that. When she'd be lookin' away from me, and I'd want to start
      sayin' something to her, you know, why, I wouldn't know how to get started
      exactly, without callin' her something. A person doesn't want to be always
      startin' off with 'See here,' or things like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why you let it trouble you,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;From how you've
      always talked about her, you had a perfectly handy way to start off with
      anything you wanted to say to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you just say, 'Oh, you Teacher's Pet!' That would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out! What I mean is, she called me 'Ramsey' without any bother; it
      seems funny I got stumped every time I started to say 'Dora.' Someway I
      couldn't land it, and it certainly would 'a' sounded crazy to call her
      'Miss Yocum' after sittin' in the same room with her every day from the
      baby class clear on up through the end of high school. That <i>would</i>
      'a' made me out an idiot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you call her?&rdquo; Fred asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just nothin' at all. I started to call her something or other a hundred
      times, I guess, and then I'd balk. I'd get all ready, and kind of make a
      sort of a sound, and then I'd have to quit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may have thought you had a cold,&rdquo; said Fred, still keeping his back
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect maybe she did&mdash;though I don't know; most of the time she
      didn't seem to notice me much, kind of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She was too upset, I guess, by what she was thinkin' about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it hadn't been for that,&rdquo; Fred suggested, &ldquo;you mean she'd have
      certainly paid more attention to who was sitting on the bench with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out! You know how it was. Everybody those few days thought we were
      goin' to have war, and she was just sure of it, and it upset her. Of
      course most people were a lot more upset by what those Dutchmen did to the
      <i>Lusitania</i> than by the idea of war; and she seemed to feel as broken
      up as anybody could be about the <i>Lusitania</i>, but what got her the
      worst was the notion of her country wantin' to fight, she said. She really
      was upset, too, Fred; there wasn't any puttin' on about it. I guess that
      ole girl certainly must have a good deal of feeling, because, doggoned,
      after we'd been sittin' there a while if she didn't have to get out her
      handkerchief! She kept her face turned away from me&mdash;just the same as
      you're doin' now to keep from laughin'&mdash;but honestly, she cried like
      somebody at a funeral. I felt like the darndest fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not laughing,&rdquo; said Fred, but he did not prove it by turning so that
      his face could be seen. &ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she didn't say such an awful lot. She said one kind o' funny thing
      though: she said she was sorry she couldn't quite control herself, but if
      anybody had to see her cry she minded it less because it was an old
      schoolmate. What struck me so kind o' funny about that is&mdash;why, it
      looks as if she never knew the way I always hated her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;It wasn't flattering!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, it <i>isn't</i>, kind of,&rdquo; Ramsey agreed, musingly. &ldquo;It
      certainly isn't when you look at it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say when she said that?&rdquo; Fred asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'. I started to, but I sort of balked again. Well, we kept on
      sitting there, and afterwhile she began to talk again and got kind of
      excited about how no war could do anything or anybody any good, and all
      war was wicked, no matter what it was about, and nothin' could be good
      that was founded on fear and hate, and every war that ever was fought was
      always founded on fear and hate. She said if the Germans wanted to fight
      us we ought to go to meet them and tell them we wouldn't fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'. I kind o' started to&mdash;but what's the use? She's got that in
      her head. Besides, how are you goin' to argue about a thing with a person
      that's crying about it? I tell you, Fred, I guess we got to admit, after
      all, that ole girl certainly must have a lots of heart about her, anyway.
      There may not be much <i>fun</i> to her&mdash;though of course I wouldn't
      know hardly any way to tell about that&mdash;but there couldn't be hardly
      any doubt she's got a lot of feeling. Well, and then she went on and said
      old men made wars, but didn't fight; they left the fighting to the boys,
      and the suffering to the boy's mothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Fred exclaimed, and upon that he turned free of mirth for the
      moment. &ldquo;That's the woman of it, I guess. Send the old men to do the
      fighting! For the matter of that, I guess my father'd about a thousand
      times go himself than see me and my brothers go; but Father's so fat he
      can't stoop! You got to be able to stoop to dig a trench, I guess! Well,
      suppose we sent our old men up against those Dutchmen; the Dutchmen would
      just kill the old men, and then come after the boys anyway, and the boys
      wouldn't be ready, and they'd get killed, too; and then there wouldn't be
      anybody but the Dutchmen left, and that'd be one fine world, wouldn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;Course I thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'. I couldn't get started anyway, but, besides, what was the use?
      But she didn't want the old men to go; she didn't want anybody to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she want the country to do?&rdquo; Fred asked, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what it has been doin', I suppose. Just let things simmer down, and
      poke along, and let them do what they like to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so!&rdquo; said Fred. &ldquo;Then, afterwhile, when they get some free time
      on their hands, they'll come over and make it <i>really</i> interesting
      for us, because they know we won't do anything but talk. Yes, I guess the
      way things are settling down ought to suit Dora. There isn't goin' to be
      any war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was pretty sure there was, though,&rdquo; Ramsey said, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course she was then. We all thought so those few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She said she thought it prob'ly wouldn't come right away, but now it
      was almost sure to come sometime. She said our telegrams and all the talk
      and so much feeling and everything showed her that the war thought that
      was always <i>in</i> people somewhere had been stirred up so it would go
      on and on. She said she knew from the way she felt herself about the <i>Lusitania</i>
      that a feeling like that in her would never be absolutely wiped out as
      long as she lived. But she said her other feeling about the horribleness
      of war taught her to keep the first feeling from breaking out, but with
      other people it wouldn't; and even if war didn't break out right then, it
      would always be ready to, all over the country, and sometime it would,
      though she was goin' to do her share to fight it, herself, as long as she
      could stand. She asked me wouldn't I be one of the ones to help her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and after a moment Fred asked, &ldquo;Well? What did you say to
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin'. I started to, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Fred thought it tactful to turn and look out the window, while the
      agitation of his shoulders betrayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on and laugh! Well, so we stayed there quite a while, but before we
      left she got kind of more like everyday, you know, the way people do. It
      was half-past nine when we walked back in town, and I was commencin' to
      feel kind of hungry, so I asked her if she wasn't, and she sort of laughed
      and seemed to be ashamed of it, as if it were a disgrace or something, but
      she said she guessed she was; so I left her by that hedge of lilacs near
      the observatory and went on over to the 'Teria and the fruit store, and
      got some stuffed eggs and olives and half-a-dozen peanut butter sandwiches
      and a box o' strawberries&mdash;kind of girl-food, you know&mdash;and went
      on back there, and we ate the stuff up. So then she said she was afraid
      she'd taken me away from my dinner and made me a lot of trouble, and so
      on, and she was sorry, and she told me good-night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noth&mdash; Oh, shut up! So then she skipped out to her Dorm, and I came
      on home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you see her next, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen her next,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;I haven't seen her at all&mdash;not
      to speak to. I saw her on Main Street twice since then, but both times she
      was with some other girls, and they were across the street, and I couldn't
      tell if she was lookin' at me&mdash;I kind of thought not&mdash;so I
      thought it might look sort o' nutty to bow to her if she wasn't, so I
      didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn't tell her you wouldn't be one of the ones to help her with
      her pacifism and anti-war stuff and all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I started to, but&mdash; Shut up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred sat up, giggling. &ldquo;So she thinks you <i>will</i> help her. You didn't
      say anything at all, and she must think that means she converted you. Why
      didn't you speak up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> wouldn't argue with her,&rdquo; said Ramsey. Then, after a
      silence, he seemed to be in need of sympathetic comprehension. &ldquo;It <i>was</i>
      kind o' funny, though, wasn't it?&rdquo; he said, appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What 'whole bus'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, get out! Her stoppin' me, and me goin' pokin' along with her, and her&mdash;well,
      her crying and everything, and me being around with her while she felt so
      upset, I mean. It seems&mdash;well, it does seem kind o' funny to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does it?&rdquo; Fred inquired, preserving his gravity. &ldquo;Why should it seem
      funny to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean funny like something's funny you laugh at,&rdquo; Ramsey explained
      laboriously. &ldquo;I mean funny like something that's out of the way, and you
      wonder how it ever happened to happen. I mean it seems funny I'd ever be
      sittin' there on a bench with that ole girl I never spoke to in my life or
      had anything to do with, and talkin' about the United States goin' to war.
      What we were talkin' about, why, that seems just as funny as the rest of
      it. Lookin' back to our class picnic, f'r instance, second year of high
      school, that day I jumped in the creek after&mdash; Well, you know, it was
      when I started makin' a fool of myself over a girl. Thank goodness, I got
      <i>that</i> out o' my system; it makes me just sick to look back on those
      days and think of the fool things I did, and all I thought about that
      girl. Why, she&mdash; Well, I've got old enough to see now she was just
      about as ordinary a girl as there ever was, and if I saw her now I
      wouldn't even think she was pretty; I'd prob'ly think she was sort of
      loud-lookin'. Well, what's passed is past, and it isn't either here nor
      there. What I started to say was this: that the way it begins to look to
      me, it looks as if nobody can tell in this life a darn thing about what's
      goin' to happen, and the things that do happen are the very ones you'd
      swear were the last that could. I mean&mdash;you look back to that day of
      the picnic&mdash;my! but I was a rube then&mdash;well, I mean you look
      back to that day, and what do you suppose I'd have thought then if
      somebody'd told me the time would ever come when I'd be 'way off here at
      college sittin' on a bench with Dora Yocum&mdash;with <i>Dora Yocum</i>,
      in the first place&mdash;and her crying, and both of us talking about the
      United States goin' to war with Germany! Don't it seem pretty funny to
      you, Fred, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as near as I can make out,&rdquo; Fred said, &ldquo;that isn't what happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say 'and both us talking' and so on. As near as I can make out, <i>you</i>
      didn't say anything at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't&mdash;much,&rdquo; Ramsey admitted, and returned to his point
      with almost pathetic persistence. &ldquo;But doesn't it seem kind o' funny to
      you, Fred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does to me,&rdquo; Ramsey insisted. &ldquo;It certainly does to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Fred cruelly. &ldquo;I've noticed you said so, but it don't look any
      funnier than you do when you say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he sent forth a startling shout. &ldquo;<i>Wow!</i> You're as red as a
      blushing beet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y'are!&rdquo; shouted Fred. &ldquo;Wow! The ole woman-hater's got the flushes! Oh,
      look at the pretty posy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, jumping down from the window seat, he began to dance round his much
      perturbed comrade, bellowing. Ramsey bore with him for a moment, then
      sprang upon him; they wrestled vigorously, broke a chair, and went to the
      floor with a crash that gave the chandelier in Mrs. Meig's parlour, below,
      an attack of jingles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let me up!&rdquo; Fred gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take your solemn oath to shut up? You goin' to swear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I give my solemn oath,&rdquo; said Fred; and they rose, arranging
      their tousled attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Fred, &ldquo;when you goin' to call on her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look here!&rdquo; Ramsey approached him dangerously. &ldquo;You just gave me your
      sol&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg!&rdquo; Fred cried, retreating. &ldquo;I mean, aside from all that, why, I just
      thought maybe after such an evening you'd feel as a gentleman you ought to
      go and ask about her health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I mean it; you ought to,&rdquo; Fred insisted, earnestly, and as his
      roommate glared at him with complete suspicion, he added, in explanation.
      &ldquo;You ought to go next Caller's Night, and send in your card, and say you
      felt you ought to ask if she'd suffered any from the night air. Even if
      you couldn't manage to say that, you ought to start to say it, anyhow,
      because you&mdash; Keep off o' me! I'm only tryin' to do you a good turn,
      ain't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You save your good turns for yourself,&rdquo; Ramsey growled, still advancing
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the insidious Mitchell, evading him, fled to the other end of the
      room, picked up his cap, and changed his manner. &ldquo;Come on, ole bag o'
      beans, let's be on our way to the 'frat house'; it's time. We'll call this
      all off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better!&rdquo; Ramsey warned him; and they trotted out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as they went along, Fred took Ramsey's arm confidentially, and said,
      &ldquo;Now, honestly, Ram, ole man, when <i>are</i> you goin' to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey was still red. &ldquo;You look here! Just say one more word&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>no</i>,&rdquo; Fred expostulated. &ldquo;I mean <i>seriously</i>, Ramsey.
      Honestly, I mean seriously. Aren't you seriously goin' to call on her some
      Caller's Night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don't want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, seriously, Ramsey, there's only one Caller's Night before vacation,
      and so I suppose it hardly will be worth while; but I expect you'll see
      quite a little of her at home this summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't. I won't see her at all. She isn't goin' to be home this
      summer, and I wouldn't see anything of her if she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's she goin' to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is?&rdquo; said Fred, slyly. &ldquo;When'd she tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey turned on him. &ldquo;You look out! She didn't tell me. I just happened
      to see in the <i>Bulletin</i> she's signed up with some other girls to go
      and do settlement work in Chicago. Anybody could see it. It was printed
      out plain. You could have seen it just as well as I could, if you'd read
      the <i>Bulletin</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now look here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! Can't I even say 'oh'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on the way you say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be careful,&rdquo; Fred assured him, earnestly. &ldquo;I really and honestly
      don't mean to get you excited about all this, Ramsey. I can see myself you
      haven't changed from your old opinion of Dora Yocum a bit. I was only
      tryin' to get a little rise out of you for a minute, because of course,
      seriously, why, I can see you hate her just the same as you always did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ramsey, disarmed and guileless in the face of diplomacy. &ldquo;I
      only told you about all this, Fred, because it seemed&mdash;well, it
      seemed so kind o' funny to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred affected not to hear. &ldquo;What did you say, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey looked vaguely disturbed. &ldquo;I said&mdash;why, I said it all seemed
      kind o'&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, then repeated plaintively: &ldquo;Well, to me, it all
      seemed kind o'&mdash;kind o' funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did?&rdquo; Fred inquired, but as he glanced in seeming naivete at his
      companion, something he saw in the latter's eye warned him, and suddenly
      Fred thought it would be better to run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey chased him all the way to the &ldquo;frat house.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ramsey was not quite athlete enough for any of the 'varsity teams; neither
      was he an antagonist safely encountered, whether in play or in earnest,
      and during the next few days he taught Fred Mitchell to be cautious. The
      chaffer learned that his own agility could not save him from Ramsey, and
      so found it wiser to contain an effervescence which sometimes threatened
      to burst him. Ramsey as a victim was a continuous temptation, he was so
      good-natured and yet so furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Commencement, when the roommates had gone home, Mr. Mitchell's
      caution extended over the long sunshiny months of summer vacation; he
      broke it but once and then in well-advised safety, for the occasion was
      semi-public. The two were out for a stroll on a July Sunday afternoon; and
      up and down the street young couples lolled along, young families and baby
      carriages straggled to and from the houses of older relatives, and the
      rest of the world of that growing city was rocking and fanning itself on
      its front veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a right pretty place, isn't it, Ramsey? don't you think?&rdquo; Fred
      remarked innocently, as they were passing a lawn of short-clipped, bright
      green grass before a genial-looking house, fresh in white paint and cool
      in green-and-white awnings. A broad veranda, well populated just now,
      crossed the front of the house; fine trees helped the awnings to give
      comfort against the sun; and Fred's remark was warranted. Nevertheless, he
      fell under the suspicion of his companion, who had begun to evince some
      nervousness before Fred spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What place do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Yocum place,&rdquo; said Mr. Mitchell. &ldquo;I hear the old gentleman's mighty
      prosperous these days. They keep things up to the mark, don't they,
      Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether they do or whether they don't,&rdquo; Ramsey returned
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred appeared to muse regretfully. &ldquo;It looks kind of <i>empty</i> now,
      though,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;with only Mr. and Mrs. Yocum and their three married
      daughters, and eight or nine children on the front porch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait till I get you where they can't see us!&rdquo; Ramsey warned him,
      fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't do it!&rdquo; said Fred, manifesting triumph. &ldquo;We'll both stop right
      here in plain sight of the whole Yocum family connection till you promise
      not to touch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he halted, leaning back implacably against the Yocum's iron fence.
      Ramsey was scandalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he said, hoarsely. &ldquo;Don't stop <i>here</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, and if you go on alone I'll yell at you. You got to stand right
      here with all of 'em lookin' at you until&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise! My heavens, come <i>on</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred consented to end the moment of agony; and for the rest of the summer
      found it impossible to persuade Ramsey to pass that house in his company.
      &ldquo;I won't do it!&rdquo; Ramsey told him. &ldquo;Your word of honour means nothin' to
      me; you're liable to do anything that comes into your head, and I'm
      gettin' old enough to not get a reputation for bein' seen with people that
      act the idiot on the public streets. No, sir; we'll walk around the block&mdash;at
      least, we will if you're goin' with <i>me</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to Fred's delight, though he concealed it, they would make this
      detour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening after their return to the university both were busy with their
      trunks and various orderings and disorderings of their apartment, but Fred
      several times expressed surprise that his roommate should be content to
      remain at home; and finally Ramsey comprehended the implications. Mrs.
      Meigs's chandelier immediately jingled with the shock of another crash
      upon the floor above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You let me up!&rdquo; Fred commanded thickly, his voice muffled by the pile of
      flannels, sweaters, underwear, and raincoats wherein his head was being
      forced to burrow. &ldquo;You let me up, darn you! <i>I</i> didn't say anything.&rdquo;
       And upon his release he complained that the attack was unprovoked. &ldquo;I
      didn't say anything on earth to even hint you might want to go out and
      look around to see if anybody in particular had got back to college yet. I
      didn't even mention the <i>name</i> of Dora Yo&mdash; Keep off o' me! My
      goodness, but you are sensitive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, neither of them saw Dora until the first meeting of
      the Lumen, whither they went as sophomores to take their pleasure in the
      agony of freshmen debaters. Ramsey was now able to attend the Lumen, not
      with complacence but at least without shuddering over the recollection of
      his own spectacular first appearance there. He had made subsequent
      appearances, far from brilliant yet not disgraceful, and as a spectator,
      at least, he usually felt rather at his ease in the place. It cannot be
      asserted, however, that he appeared entirely at his ease this evening
      after he had read the &ldquo;Programme&rdquo; chalked upon the large easel blackboard
      beside the chairman's desk. Three &ldquo;Freshmen Debates&rdquo; were announced, and a
      &ldquo;Sophomore Oration,&rdquo; this last being followed by the name, &ldquo;D. Yocum,
      '18.&rdquo; Ramsey made immediate and conspicuous efforts to avoid sitting next
      to his roommate, but was not so adroit as to be successful. However, Fred
      was merciful: the fluctuations of his friend's complexion were an
      inspiration more to pity than to badinage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three debates all concerned the &ldquo;Causes of the War in Europe,&rdquo; and
      honours appeared to rest with a small and stout, stolidly &ldquo;pro-German&rdquo;
       girl debater, who had brought with her and translated at sight absa-loot
      proofs (so she called them), printed in German, that Germany had been
      attacked by Belgium at the low instigation of the envious English.
      Everybody knew it wasn't true; but she made an impression and established
      herself as a debater, especially as her opponent was quite confounded by
      her introduction of printed matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the debates and the verdicts were concluded, the orator appeared, and
      Fred's compassion extended itself so far that he even refrained from
      looking inquisitively at the boy in the seat next to his; but he made one
      side wager, mentally&mdash;that if Ramsey had consented to be thoroughly
      confidential just then, he would have confessed to feeling kind o' funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora was charmingly dressed, and she was pale; but those notable eyelashes
      of hers were all the more notable against her pallor. And as she spoke
      with fire, it was natural that her colour should come back quite flamingly
      and that her eyes should flash in shelter of the lashes. &ldquo;The Christian
      Spirit and Internationalism&rdquo; was her subject, yet she showed no meek
      sample of a Christian Spirit herself when she came to attacking war-makers
      generally, as well as all those &ldquo;half-developed tribesmen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;victims
      of herd instinct&rdquo; who believed that war might ever be justified under any
      circumstances of atrocity. She was eloquent truly, and a picture of grace
      and girlish dignity, even when she was most vigorous. Nothing could have
      been more militant than her denunciation of militancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's an actual wonder,&rdquo; Fred said, when the two had got back to Mrs.
      Meigs's, afterward. &ldquo;Don't you look at me like that: I'm talkin' about her
      as a public character, and there's nothin' personal about it. You let me
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey was not clear as to his duty. &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any person makes a public speech,&rdquo; Fred protested, &ldquo;I got a perfect
      right to discuss 'em, no matter what you think of 'em&rdquo;&mdash;and he added
      hastily&mdash;&ldquo;or <i>don't</i> think of 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; Fred exclaimed. &ldquo;You aren't expecting to interfere with me
      if I say anything about that little fat Werder girl that argued for
      Germany, are you? Or any of the other speakers? I got a right to talk
      about 'em just as public speakers, haven't I? Well, what I say is: Dora
      Yocum as an orator is just an actual perfect wonder. Got any objections?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right then.&rdquo; Fred settled himself upon the window seat with a pipe,
      and proceeded, &ldquo;There's something about her, when she stands there, she
      stands so straight and knows just what she's up to, and everything, why,
      there's something about her makes the cold chills go down your spine&mdash;I
      mean <i>my</i> spine, not yours particularly! You sit down&mdash;I mean <i>anybody's</i>
      spine, doggone it!&rdquo; And as Ramsey increased the manifestations of his
      suspicions, lifting a tennis racket over the prostrate figure, &ldquo;Oh,
      murder,&rdquo; Fred said, resignedly. &ldquo;All right, we'll change the subject. That
      fat little Werder cutie made out a pretty good case for Germany, didn't
      she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey tossed the racket away, disposed himself in an easy chair with his
      feet upon the table, and presently chuckled. &ldquo;You remember the time I had
      the fuss with Wesley Bender, back in the ole school days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the flubdub this Werder girl got off to-night puts me in mind of the
      way I talked that day. I can remember it as well as anything! Wesley kept
      yelpin' that whoever mentioned a lady's name in a public place was a pup,
      and of course I didn't want to hit him for that; a boy's got a reg'lar
      instinct for tryin' to make out he's on the right side in a scrap, and
      he'll always try to do something, or say something, or he'll get the other
      boy to say someting to make it look as if the other boy was in the wrong
      and began the trouble. So I told poor ole Wes that my father spoke my
      mother's name in a public place whenever he wanted to, and I dared him to
      say my father was a pup. And all so on. A boy startin' up a scrap, why,
      half the time he'll drag his father and mother if there's any chance to do
      it. He'll fix up some way so he can say, 'Well, that's just the same as if
      you called my father and mother a fool,' or something like that. Then,
      afterward, he can claim he was scrappin' because he had to defend his
      father and mother, and of course he'll more than half believe it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you take a Government&mdash;it's only just some <i>men</i>, the way
      I see it, and if they're goin' to start some big trouble like this war,
      why, of course they'll play just about the same ole boy trick, because
      it's instinct to do it, just the same for a man as it is for a boy&mdash;or
      else the principle's just the same, or something. Well, anyhow, if you
      want to know who started a scrap and worked it up, you got to forget all
      the <i>talk</i> there is about it, and all what each side <i>says</i>, and
      just look at two things: Who was fixed for it first, or thought they were,
      and who hit first? When you get the answer to those two questions
      everything's settled about all this being 'attacked' business. Both sides,
      just the same as boys, they'll both claim they <i>had</i> to fight; but if
      you want to know which one <i>did</i> have to, why forget all the arguing
      and don't take your eye off just what <i>happened</i>. As near as I can
      make out, this war began with Germany and Austria startin' in to wipe out
      two little countries; Austria began shootin' up Serbia, and Germany began
      shootin' up Belgium. I don't need to notice any more than that, myself&mdash;all
      the Werder girls in the country can debate their heads off, they can't
      change what happened and they can't excuse it, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, appearing to feel that he had concluded conclusively, and
      the young gentleman on the window seat, after staring at him for several
      moments of genuine thoughtfulness, was gracious enough to observe, &ldquo;Well,
      ole Ram, you may be a little slow in class, but when you think things out
      with yourself you do show signs of something pretty near like real
      horse-sense sometimes. Why don't you ever say anything like that to&mdash;to
      some of your pacifist friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Who you talkin' about? Whose 'pacifist friends'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here!&rdquo; Fred exclaimed, as Ramsey seemed about to rise. &ldquo;You keep
      sitting just where you are, and don't look at me out of the side of your
      eye like that&mdash;pretendin' you're a bad horse. I'm <i>really</i>
      serious now, and you listen to me. I don't think argufying and debating
      like that little Fraulein Werder's does much harm. She's a right nifty
      young rolypoly, by the way, though you didn't notice, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't I?&rdquo; Ramsey demanded, sharply. &ldquo;Why didn't I notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. But, as I was saying, I don't think that sort of talk does
      much harm: everybody knows it goes on among the pro-Germans, and it's all
      hot air, anyhow. But I think Linski's sort of talk does do harm, prob'ly
      among people that don't know much; and what's more, I think Dora Yocum's
      does some, too. Well, you hit Linski in the snoot, so what are you&mdash;
      Sit still! My lord! You don't think I'm askin' you to go and hit Dora, do
      you? I mean: Aren't you ever goin' to talk to her about it and tell her
      what's what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you go on to bed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm in earnest,&rdquo; Fred urged. &ldquo;Honestly, aren't you ever goin' to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I do anything like that?&rdquo; Ramsey demanded explosively. &ldquo;I never
      see her&mdash;to speak to, that is. I prob'ly won't happen to have another
      talk with her, or anything, all the time we're in college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Fred admitted, &ldquo;I suppose not. Of course, if you did, then you would
      give her quite a talking-to, just the way you did the other time, wouldn't
      you?&rdquo; But upon that, another resumption of physical violence put an end to
      the conversation.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the term Ramsey's calculation of probabilities against the
      happening of another interview with Dora seemed to be well founded, but at
      the beginning of the second &ldquo;semester&rdquo; he found her to be a fellow member
      of a class in biology. More than that, this class had every week a
      two-hour session in the botanical laboratory, where the structure of
      plants was studied under microscopic dissection. The students worked in
      pairs, a special family of plants being assigned to each couple; and the
      instructor selected the couples with an eye to combinations of the quick
      with the slow. D. Yocum and R. Milholland (the latter in a strange state
      of mind and complexion) were given two chairs, but only one desk and one
      microscope. Their conversation was strictly botanical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforth it became the most pressing care of Ramsey's life to prevent
      his roommate from learning that there was any conversation at all, even
      botanical. Fortunately, Fred was not taking the biological courses, though
      he appeared to be taking the sentimental ones with an astonishing
      thoroughness; and sometimes, to Fred's hilarious delight, Ramsey attempted
      to turn the tables and rally him upon whatever last affair seemed to be
      engaging his fancy. The old Victorian and pre-Victorian <i>blague</i> word
      &ldquo;petticoat&rdquo; had been revived in Fred's vocabulary, and in others, as
      &ldquo;skirt.&rdquo; The lightsome sprig was hourly to be seen, even when university
      rulings forbade, dilly-dallying giddily along the campus paths or the town
      sidewalks with some new and pretty Skirt. And when Ramsey tried to fluster
      him about such a matter Fred would profess his ardent love for the new
      lady in shouts and impromptu song. Nothing could be done to him, and
      Ramsey, utterly unable to defend his own sensibilities in like manner, had
      always to retire in bafflement. Sometimes he would ponder upon the
      question thus suggested: Why couldn't he do this sort of thing, since Fred
      could? But he never discovered a satisfying answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey's watchfulness was so careful (lest he make some impulsive
      admission in regard to the botanical laboratory, for instance) that Mr.
      Mitchell's curiosity gradually became almost quiescent; but there arrived
      a day in February when it was piqued into the liveliest activity. It was
      Sunday, and Fred, dressing with a fastidiousness ever his daily habit,
      noticed that Ramsey was exhibiting an unusual perplexity about neckties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep the black one on,&rdquo; Fred said, volunteering the suggestion, as Ramsey
      muttered fiercely at a mirror. &ldquo;It's in better taste for church, anyhow.
      You're going to church, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I've got a luncheon engagement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you could go to church first, couldn't you? You better; you've got
      a lot of church absences against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then one more won't hurt. No church in mine this morning, thanks! G'by,
      ole sox; see you at the 'frat house' for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went forth, whistling syncopations, and began a brisk trudge into the
      open country. There was a professor's daughter who also was not going to
      church that morning; and she lived a little more than three miles beyond
      the outskirts of the town. Unfortunately, as the weather was threatening,
      all others of her family abandoned the idea of church that day, and Fred
      found her before a cozy fire, but surrounded by parents, little brothers,
      and big sisters. The professor was talkative; Fred's mind might have been
      greatly improved, but with a window in range he preferred a melancholy
      contemplation of the snow, which had begun to fall in quantity. The
      professor talked until luncheon, throughout luncheon, and was well under
      way to fill the whole afternoon with talk, when Fred, repenting all the
      errors of his life, got up to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heartily urged to remain, for there was now something just under a
      blizzard developing, he said No; he had a great deal of &ldquo;cirriculum work&rdquo;
       to get done before the morrow, and passed from the sound of the
      professor's hospitable voice and into the storm. He had a tedious struggle
      against the wind and thickening snow, but finally came in sight of the
      town, not long before dark. Here the road led down into a depression, and,
      lifting his head as he began the slight ascent on the other side, Fred was
      aware of two figures outlined upon the low ridge before him. They were
      dimmed by the driving snow and their backs were toward him, but he
      recognized them with perfect assurance. They were Dora Yocum and Ramsey
      Milholland.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were walking so slowly that their advance was almost imperceptible,
      but it could be seen that Dora was talking with great animation; and she
      was a graceful thing, thus gesticulating, in her long, slim fur coat with
      the white snow frosting her brown fur cap. Ramsey had his hands deep in
      his overcoat pockets and his manner was wholly that of an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred murmured to himself, &ldquo;'What did you say to her?' 'Nothin'. I started
      to, but'&mdash;&rdquo; Then he put on a burst of speed and passed them, sweeping
      off his hat with operatic deference, yet hurrying by as if fearful of
      being thought a killjoy if he lingered. He went to the &ldquo;frat house,&rdquo; found
      no one downstairs, and established himself in a red leather chair to smoke
      and ruminate merrily by a great fire in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Ramsey entered, stamped off the snow, hung up his hat
      and coat, and sat himself down defiantly in the red leather chair on the
      other side of the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Commence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; Fred returned, amiably. &ldquo;Fine spring weather to-day. Lovely
      to see all the flowers and the birds as we go a-strolling by. The little
      bobolinks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look here! That's the only walk I ever took with her in my life. I
      mean by&mdash;by asking her and her saying she would and so forth. That
      other time just sort of happened, and you know it. Well, the weather
      wasn't just the best in the world, maybe, but she's an awful conscientious
      girl and once she makes an engagement&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; Fred finished for him, &ldquo;She'd be too pious to break it
      just on account of a mere little blizzard or anything. Wonder how the
      weather will be next Sunday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know and I don't care,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;You don't suppose I asked
      her to go <i>again</i>, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for one thing, you don't suppose I want her to think I'm a perfect
      fool, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred mused a moment or two, looking at the fire. &ldquo;What was the lecture?&rdquo;
       he asked, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What lecture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seemed to me to be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn't lecturing; she was just&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well; she thinks war for the United States is coming closer and closer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she thinks so, anyhow,&rdquo; said Ramsey, &ldquo;and she's all broken up about
      it. Of course she thinks we oughtn't to fight and she's trying to get
      everybody else she can to keep working against it. She isn't goin' home
      again next summer, she's goin' back to that settlement work in Chicago and
      work there among those people against our goin' to war; and here in
      college she wants to get everybody she can to talk against it, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Fred asked, and himself supplied the reply: &ldquo;Nothin'.
      I started to, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey got up. &ldquo;Now look here! You know the 'frat' passed a rule that if
      we broke any more furniture in this house with our scrappin' we'd both be
      fined the cost of repairs and five dollars apiece. Well, I can afford five
      dollars this month better than you can, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it back!&rdquo; Fred interposed, hastily. &ldquo;But you just listen to me;
      you look out&mdash;letting her think you're on her side like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>don't?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey looked dogged. &ldquo;I'm not goin' around always arguin' about
      everything when arguin' would just hurt people's feelings about something
      they're all excited about, and wouldn't do a bit o' good in the world&mdash;and
      you know yourself just <i>talk</i> hardly ever settles anything&mdash;so I
      don't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; Fred cried. &ldquo;I thought so! Now you listen to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this moment they were interrupted. Someone slyly opened the door,
      and a snowball deftly thrown from without caught Ramsey upon the back of
      the neck and head, where it flattened and displayed itself as an
      ornamental star. Shouting fiercely, both boys sprang up, ran to the door,
      were caught there in a barrage of snowballs, ducked through it in spite of
      all damage, charged upon a dozen besweatered figures awaiting them and
      began a mad battle in the blizzard. Some of their opponents treacherously
      joined them, and turned upon the ambushers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dusk the merry conflict waged up and down the snow-covered lawn,
      and the combatants threw and threw, or surged back and forth, or clenched
      and toppled over into snow banks, yet all coming to chant an extemporized
      battle-cry in chorus, even as they fought the most wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Who? Who?&rdquo; they chanted. &ldquo;Who? Who? <i>Who</i> says there ain't
      goin' to be no war?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      So everywhere over the country, that winter of 1916, there were
      light-hearted boys skylarking&mdash;at college, or on the farms; and in
      the towns the young machinists snowballed one another as they came from
      the shops; while on this Sunday of the &ldquo;frat&rdquo; snow fight probably several
      hundreds of thousands of youthful bachelors, between the two oceans, went
      walking, like Ramsey, each with a girl who could forget the weather. Yet
      boys of nineteen and in the twenties were not light-hearted all the time
      that winter and that spring and that summer. Most of them knew long,
      thoughtful moments, as Ramsey did, when they seemed to be thinking not of
      girls or work or play&mdash;nor of anything around them, but of some more
      vital matter or prospect. And at such times they were grave, but not
      ungentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the long strain was on the country; underneath all its outward seeming
      of things going on as usual there shook a deep vibration, like the air
      trembling to vast organ pipes in diapasons too profound to reach the ear
      as sound: one felt, not heard, thunder in the ground under one's feet. The
      succession of diplomatic Notes came to an end after the torpedoing of the
      <i>Sussex</i>; and at last the tricky ruling Germans in Berlin gave their
      word to murder no more, and people said, &ldquo;This means peace for America,
      and all is well for us,&rdquo; but everybody knew in his heart that nothing was
      well for us, that there was no peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said &ldquo;All is well,&rdquo; while that thunder in the ground never ceased&mdash;it
      grew deeper and heavier till all America shook with it and it became
      slowly audible as the voice of the old American soil wherein lay those who
      had defended it aforetime, a soil that bred those who would defend it
      again, for it was theirs; and the meaning of it&mdash;Life, Liberty, and
      the Pursuit of Happiness&mdash;was theirs, and theirs to defend. And they
      knew they would defend it, and that more than the glory of a Nation was at
      stake. The Freedom of Man was at stake. So, gradually, the sacred thunder
      reached the ears of the young men and gave them those deep moments that
      came to them whether they sat in the classroom or the counting-room, or
      walked with the plow, or stood to the machine, or behind the ribbon
      counter. Thus the thunder shook them and tried them and slowly came into
      their lives and changed everything for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hate of the Germans was not bred; but a contempt for what Germany had
      shown in lieu of a national heart; a contempt as mighty and profound as
      the resolve that the German way and the German will should prevail in
      America, nor in any country of the world that would be free. And when the
      German Kaiser laid his command upon America, that no American should take
      his ship upon the free seas, death being the penalty for any who
      disobeyed, then the German Kaiser got his answer, not only to this new law
      he had made for us, but to many other thoughts of his. Yet the answer was
      for some time delayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bitter Sunday, and its bitterness went everywhere, to every
      place in the whole world that held high and generous hearts. Its
      bitterness came to the special meeting in the &ldquo;Frat hall,&rdquo; where there
      were hearts, indeed, of that right sort, and one of them became vocal in
      its bitterness. This was the heart of Fred Mitchell, who was now an
      authority, being president of the Junior Class, chairman of the Prom
      Committee, and other things pleasant to be and to live for at his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me, Brothers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'd think I'd a great deal rather have been
      shot through the head than heard the news from Washington to-day! I tell
      you, I've spent the meanest afternoon I ever did in my life, and I guess
      it's been pretty much the same with all of us. The worst of it is, it
      looks as though there isn't a thing in the world we can do. The country's
      been betrayed by a few blatherskites and boneheads that had the power to
      do it, and all we can do we've just got to stand it. But there's some
      Americans that aren't just standing it, and I want to tell you a lot of
      'em are men from the universities, just like us. They're <i>over there</i>
      right now; they haven't said much&mdash;they just packed up and went.
      They're flying for France and for England and for Canada; they're fighting
      under every flag on the right side of the Western Front; and they're
      driving ambulances at Verdun and ammunition trucks at the Somme. Well,
      there's going to be a lot more American boys on all these jobs mighty
      soon, on account of what those men did in Congress to-day. If they won't
      give us a chance to do something under our own flag, then we'll have to go
      and do it under some other flag; and I want to tell you I'm one that's
      going to <i>go!</i> I'll stick it out in college up to Easter, and then if
      there's still no chance to go under the Stars and Stripes I'll maybe have
      to go under the flag my great-great-grandfather fought against in 1776,
      but, anyhow, I'll <i>go!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in speaking to Ramsey of this declaration that Dora said Fred was a
      &ldquo;dangerous firebrand.&rdquo; They were taking another February walk, but the
      February was February, 1917; and the day was dry and sunny. &ldquo;It's just
      about a year ago,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo; Ramsey asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That first time we went walking. Don't you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>that</i> day? Yes, I remember it was snowing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so cold and blowy!&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;It seems a long time ago. I like
      walking with you, Ramsey. You're so quiet and solid&mdash;I've always felt
      I could talk to you just anyhow I pleased, and you wouldn't mind. I'll
      miss these walks with you when we're out of college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled. &ldquo;That's funny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we've only taken four besides this: two last year, and another
      week before last, and another last week. This is only the fifth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious! Is that all? It seemed to me we'd gone ever so often!&rdquo; She
      laughed. &ldquo;I'm afraid you won't think that seems much as if I'd liked
      going, but I really have. And, by the way, you've never called on me at
      all. Perhaps it's because I've forgotten to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Ramsey said, and scuffed his shoes on the path, presently
      explaining rather huskily that he &ldquo;never <i>was</i> much of a caller&rdquo;; and
      he added, &ldquo;or anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you must come if you ever care to,&rdquo; she said, with a big-sister
      graciousness. &ldquo;The Dorm chaperon sits there, of course, but ours is a
      jolly one and you'd like her. You've probably met her&mdash;Mrs. Hustings?&mdash;when
      you've called on other girls at our old shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ramsey. &ldquo;I never was much of a&mdash;&rdquo; He paused, fearing that
      he might be repeating himself, and too hastily amended his intention. &ldquo;I
      never liked any girl enough to go and call on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramsey Milholland!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why, when we were in school half the room
      used to be talking about how you and that pretty Milla&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; Ramsey protested, again too hurriedly. &ldquo;I never called on her.
      We just went walking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later his colour suddenly became fiery. &ldquo;I don't mean&mdash;I
      mean&mdash;&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;It was walking, of course&mdash;I mean we did
      go out walking but it wasn't walking like&mdash;like this.&rdquo; He concluded
      with a fit of coughing which seemed to rack him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora threw back her head and laughed delightfully. &ldquo;Don't you apologize!&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;<i>I</i> didn't when I said it seemed to me that we've gone
      walking so often, when in reality it's only four or five times altogether.
      I think I can explain, though: I think it came partly from a feeling I
      have that I can rely on you&mdash;that you're a good, solid, reliable sort
      of person. I remember from the time we were little children, you always
      had a sort of worried, honest look in school; and you used to make a dent
      in your forehead&mdash;you meant it for a frown&mdash;whenever I caught
      your eye. You hated me so honestly, and you were so honestly afraid I
      wouldn't see it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;yes!&rdquo; she laughed, then grew serious. &ldquo;My feeling about you&mdash;that
      you were a person to be relied on, I mean&mdash;I think it began that
      evening in our freshman year, after the <i>Lusitania</i>, when I stopped
      you on campus and you went with me, and I couldn't help crying, and you
      were so nice and quiet. I hardly realized then that it was the first time
      we'd ever really talked together&mdash;of course <i>I</i> did all the
      talking!&mdash;and yet we'd known each other so many years. I thought of
      it afterward. But what gave me such a different view of you, I'd always
      thought you were one of that truculent sort of boys, always just bursting
      for a fight; but you showed me you'd really never had a fight in your life
      and hated fighting, and that you sympathized with my feeling about war.&rdquo;
       She stopped speaking to draw in her breath with a sharp sigh. &ldquo;Ah, don't
      you remember what I've told you all along? How it keeps coming closer and
      closer&mdash;and now it's almost here! Isn't it <i>unthinkable?</i> And
      what can we do to stop it, we poor few who feel that we <i>must</i> stop
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Ramsey began uncomfortably. &ldquo;Of course I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't do much,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know. None of us can. What can any
      little group do? There are so few of us among the undergraduates&mdash;and
      only one in the whole faculty. All the rest are for war. But we mustn't
      give up; we must never feel afterward that we left anything undone; we
      must fight to the last breath!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Fight'?&rdquo; he repeated wonderingly, then chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as a figure of speech,&rdquo; she said, impatiently. &ldquo;Our language is full
      of barbaric figures left over from the dark ages. But, oh, Ramsey!&rdquo;&mdash;she
      touched his sleeve&mdash;&ldquo;I've heard that Fred Mitchell is saying that
      he's going to Canada after Easter, to try to get into the Canadian
      aviation corps. If it's true, he's a dangerous firebrand, I think. Is it
      true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so. He's been talking that way some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you <i>let</i> him talk that way?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He's your
      roommate; surely you have more influence with him than anybody else has.
      Couldn't you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head slowly, while upon his face the faintly indicated
      modellings of a grin hinted of an inner laughter at some surreptitious
      thought. &ldquo;Well, you know, Fred says himself sometimes, I don't seem to be
      much of a talker exactly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. But don't you see? That sort of thing is contagious. Others will
      think they ought to go if he does; he's popular and quite a leader. Can't
      you do anything with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited for him to answer. &ldquo;Can't you?&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grin had disappeared, and Ramsey grew red again. He seemed to wish to
      speak, to heave with speech that declined to be spoken and would not rouse
      up from his inwards. Finally he uttered words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A man&mdash;or a boy!&mdash;always hates to be
      intruding his own convictions upon other men, especially in a case like
      this, where he might be afraid of some idiot's thinking him unmanlike. But
      Ramsey&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly she broke off and looked at him attentively; his
      discomfort had become so obvious that suspicion struck her. She spoke
      sharply. &ldquo;Ramsey <i>you</i> aren't dreaming of doing such a thing, are
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What such a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fred hasn't influenced <i>you</i>, has he? You aren't planning to go with
      him, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To join the Canadian aviation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I hadn't thought of doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sighed again, relieved. &ldquo;I had a queer feeling about you just then&mdash;that
      you <i>were</i> thinking of doing some such thing. You looked so odd&mdash;and
      you're always so quiet, anybody might not really know what you do think.
      But I'm not wrong about you, am I, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had come to the foot of the steps that led up to the entrance of her
      dormitory, and their walk was at an end. As they stopped and faced each
      other, she looked at him earnestly; but he did not meet the scrutiny, his
      eyelids fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not wrong, am I, Ramsey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what?&rdquo; he murmured, uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my friend, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's all right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That relieves me and makes me happier
      than I was just now, for of course if you're my friend you wouldn't let me
      make any mistake about you. I believe you, and now, just before I go in
      and we won't see much of each other for a week&mdash;if you still want me
      to go with you again next Sunday&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;won't you, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if you like. But I want to tell you now that I count on you in all
      this, even though you don't 'talk much,' as you say; I count on you more
      than I do on anybody else, and I trust you when you say you're my friend,
      and it makes me happy. And I think perhaps you're right about Fred
      Mitchell. Talk isn't everything, nobody knows that better than I, who talk
      so much! and I think that, instead of talking to Fred, a steady, quiet
      influence like yours would do more good than any amount of arguing. So I
      trust you, you see? And I'm sorry I had that queer doubt of you.&rdquo; She held
      out her hand. &ldquo;Unless I happen to see you on the campus for a minute, in
      the meantime, it's good-bye until a week from to-day. So&mdash;well, so,
      good-bye until then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Ramsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a great struggle. &ldquo;I'm not influencing Fred not to go,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I&mdash;don't want you to trust me to do anything like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's all right for him to go, if he wants to,&rdquo; Ramsey said,
      miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do? For him to go to <i>fight?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swallowed. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; she cried, turned even redder than he, and ran up the stone
      steps. But before the storm doors closed upon her she looked down to where
      he stood, with his eyes still lowered, a lonely-seeming figure, upon the
      pavement below. Her voice caught upon a sob as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel like that, you might as well go and enlist, yourself,&rdquo; she
      said, bitterly. &ldquo;I can't&mdash;I couldn't&mdash;speak to you again after
      this!&rdquo;

      Chapter XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was easy enough for him to evade Fred Mitchell's rallyings these days;
      the sprig's mood was truculent, not toward his roommate but toward
      Congress, which was less in fiery haste than he to be definitely at war
      with Germany. All through the university the change had come: athletics,
      in other years spotlighted at the centre of the stage, languished
      suddenly, threatened with abandonment; students working for senior honours
      forgot them; everything was forgotten except that growing thunder in the
      soil. Several weeks elapsed after Dora's bitter dismissal of Ramsey before
      she was mentioned between the comrades. Then, one evening, Fred asked, as
      he restlessly paced their study floor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen your pacifist friend lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Not exactly. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for my part, I think she ought to be locked up,&rdquo; Fred said,
      angrily. &ldquo;Have you heard what she did this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over college. She got up in the class in jurisprudence and made
      a speech. It's a big class, you know, over two hundred, under Dean Burney.
      He's a great lecturer, but he's a pacifist&mdash;the only one on the
      faculty&mdash;and a friend of Dora's. They say he encouraged her to make
      this break and led the subject around so she could do it, and then called
      on her for an opinion, as the highest-stand student in the class. She got
      up and claimed there wasn't any such thing as a legitimate cause for war,
      either legally or morally, and said it was a sign of weakness in a nation
      for it to believe that it did have cause for war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was too much for that little, spunky Joe Stansbury, and he
      jumped up and argued with her. He made her admit all the Germans have done
      to us, the sea murders and the land murders, the blowing up of the
      factories, the propaganda, the strikes, trying to turn the United States
      into a German settlement, trying to get Japan and Mexico to make war on
      us, and all the rest. He even made her admit there was proof they mean to
      conquer us when they get through with the others, and that they've set out
      to rule the world for their own benefit, and make whoever else they kindly
      allow to live, to work for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said it might be true, but since nothing at all could be a right
      cause for war, than all this couldn't be a cause of war. Of course she had
      her regular pacifist 'logic' working; she said that since war is the worst
      thing there is, why, all other evils were lesser, and a lesser evil can't
      be a just cause for a greater. She got terribly excited, they say, but
      kept right on, anyway. She said war was murder and there couldn't be any
      other way to look at it; and she'd heard there was already talk in the
      university of students thinking about enlisting, and whoever did such a
      thing was virtually enlisting to return murder for murder. Then Joe
      Stansbury asked her if she meant that she'd feel toward any student that
      enlisted the way she would toward a murderer, and she said, yes, she'd
      have a horror of any student that enlisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that broke up the class; Joe turned from her to the platform and
      told old Burney that he was responsible for allowing such talk in his
      lecture-room, and Joe said so far as <i>he</i> was concerned, he resigned
      from Burney's classes right there. That started it, and practically the
      whole class got up and walked out with Joe. They said Burney streaked off
      home, and Dora was left alone in there, with her head down on her desk&mdash;and
      I guess she certainly deserves it. A good many have already stopped
      speaking to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey fidgeted with a pen on the table by which he sat. &ldquo;Well, I don't
      know,&rdquo; he said, slowly; &ldquo;I don't know if they ought to do that exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why oughtn't they?&rdquo; Fred demanded, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it looks to me as if she was only fightin' for her principles. She
      believes in 'em. The more it costs a person to stick to their principles,
      why, the more I believe the person must have something pretty fine about
      'em likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said the hot-headed Fred. &ldquo;That may be in ordinary times, but not
      when a person's principles are liable to betray their country! We won't
      stand that kind of principles, I tell you, and we oughtn't to. Dora
      Yocum's finding that out, all right. She had the biggest position of any
      girl in this place, or any boy either, up to the last few weeks, and there
      wasn't any student or hardly even a member of the faculty that had the
      influence or was more admired and looked up to. She had the whole show!
      But now, since she's just the same as called any student a murderer if he
      enlists to fight for his country and his flag&mdash;well, now she hasn't
      got anything at all, and if she keeps on she'll have even less!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused in his walking to and fro and came to a halt behind his friend's
      chair, looking down compassionately upon the back of Ramsey's motionless
      head. His tone changed. &ldquo;I guess it isn't just the ticket&mdash;me to be
      talking this way to you, is it?&rdquo; he said, with a trace of huskiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;it's all right,&rdquo; Ramsey murmured, not altering his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help blowing up,&rdquo; Fred went on. &ldquo;I want to say, though, I know
      I'm not very considerate to blow up about her to you this way. I've been
      playing horse with you about her ever since freshman year, but&mdash;well,
      you must have understood, Ram, I never meant anything that would really
      bother you much, and I thought&mdash;well, I <i>really</i> thought it was
      a good thing, you&mdash;your&mdash;well, I mean about her, you know. I'm
      on, all right. I know it's pretty serious with you.&rdquo; He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ramsey did not move, except that his right hand still fidgeted with the
      pen upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's&mdash;it's kind of tough luck!&rdquo; his friend contrived to say; and he
      began to pace the floor again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, ole stick-in-the-mud,&rdquo; Fred broke out abruptly. &ldquo;After her
      saying what she did&mdash; Well, it's none o' my business, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; Ramsey murmured. &ldquo;I don't care what you say, if you want to
      say anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I <i>got</i> to say it,&rdquo; Fred half groaned and half blurted. &ldquo;After
      she said <i>that</i>&mdash;and she meant it&mdash;why, if I were in your
      place I'd be darned if I'd be seen out walking with her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to be,&rdquo; Ramsey said, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; And now Fred halted in front of him, both being huskily
      solemn. &ldquo;I think I understand a little of what that means to you, old
      Ramsey; I think I do. I think I know something of what it costs you to
      make that resolution for your country's sake.&rdquo; Impulsively he extended his
      hand. &ldquo;It's a pretty big thing for you to do. Will you shake hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ramsey shook his head. &ldquo;I didn't do it. I wouldn't ever have done
      anything just on account of her talkin' that way. She shut the door on me&mdash;it
      was a good while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did! What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm not much of a talker, you know, Fred,&rdquo; said Ramsey, staring at
      the pen he played with. &ldquo;I'm not much of anything, for that matter,
      prob'ly, but I&mdash;well&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I had to tell her I didn't feel about things the way she did. She'd
      thought I had, all along, I guess. Anyway, it made her hate me or
      something, I guess; and she called it all off. I expect there wasn't much
      to call off, so far as she was concerned, anyhow.&rdquo; He laughed feebly. &ldquo;She
      told me I better go and enlist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pleasant of her!&rdquo; Fred muttered. &ldquo;Especially as we know what she thinks
      enlisting means.&rdquo; He raised his voice cheerfully. &ldquo;Well, that's settled;
      and, thank God, old Mr. Bernstorff's on his way to his sweet little
      vine-clad cottage home! They're getting guns on the ships, and the big
      show's liable to commence any day. We can hold up our heads now, and we're
      going to see some great times, old Ramsey boy! It's hard on the home folks&mdash;Gosh!
      I don't like to think of that! And I guess it's going to be hard on a lot
      of boys that haven't understood what it's all about, and hard on some that
      their family affairs, and business, and so on, have got 'em tied up so
      it's hard to go&mdash;and of course there's plenty that just can't, and
      some that aren't husky enough&mdash;but the rest of us are going to have
      the big time in our lives. We got an awful lot to learn; it scares me to
      think of what I don't know about being any sort of a rear-rank private.
      Why, it's a regular <i>profession</i>, like practising law, or selling for
      a drug house on the road. Golly! Do you remember how we talked about that,
      'way back in freshman year, what we were going to do when we got out of
      college? You were going to be practising law, for instance, and I&mdash;well,
      f'r instance, remember Colburn; he was going to be a doctor, and he did go
      to some medical school for one year. Now he's in the Red Cross, somewhere
      in <i>Persia</i>. Golly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused to digest this impossibility, then chattered briskly on. &ldquo;Well,
      there's <i>one</i> good old boy was with our class for a while, back in
      freshman year; I bet we won't see him in any good old army! Old rough-neck
      Linski that you put the knob on his nose for. Tommie Hopper says he saw
      him last summer in Chicago soapboxin', yellin' his head off cussin' every
      government under the sun, but mostly ours and the Allies', you bet, and
      going to run the earth by revolution and representatives of unskilled
      labour immigrants, nobody that can read or write allowed to vote, except
      Linski. Tommie Hopper says he knows all about Linski; he never did a day's
      work in his life&mdash;too busy trying to get the workingmen stirred up
      against the people that exploit 'em! Tommie says he had a big crowd to
      hear him, though, and took up quite a little money for a 'cause' or
      something. Well, let him holler! I guess we can attend to him when we get
      back from over yonder. By George, old Ram, I'm gettin' kind of floppy in
      the gills!&rdquo; He administered a resounding slap to his comrade's shoulder.
      &ldquo;It certainly looks as if our big days were walking toward us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was right. The portentous days came on apace, and each one brought a
      new and greater portent. The faces of men lost a driven look besetting
      them in the days of badgered waiting, and instead of that heavy
      apprehension one saw the look men's faces must have worn in 1776 and 1861,
      and the history of the old days grew clearer in the new. The President
      went to the Congress, and the true indictment he made there reached
      scoffing Potsdam with an unspoken prophecy somewhat chilling even to
      Potsdam, one guesses&mdash;and then through an April night went almost
      quietly the steady work: we were at war with Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bugles sounded across the continent; drums and fifes played up and
      down the city streets and in town and village squares and through the
      countrysides. Faintly in all ears there was multitudinous noise like
      distant, hoarse cheering... and a sound like that was what Dora Yocum
      heard, one night, as she sat lonely in her room. The bugles and fifes and
      drums had been heard about the streets of the college town, that day, and
      she thought she must die of them, they hurt her so, and now to be haunted
      by this imaginary cheering&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. Was it imaginary?
    </p>
    <p>
      She went downstairs and stood upon the steps of the dormitory in the open
      air. No; the cheering was real and loud. It came from the direction of the
      railway station, and the night air surged and beat with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below her stood the aged janitor of the building, listening. &ldquo;What's the
      cheering for?&rdquo; she asked, remembering grimly that the janitor was one of
      her acquaintances who had not yet stopped &ldquo;speaking&rdquo; to her. &ldquo;What's the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a good matter,&rdquo; the old man answered. &ldquo;I guess there must be a big
      crowd of 'em down there. One of our students enlisted to-day, and they're
      givin' him a send-off. Listen to 'em, how they <i>do</i> cheer. He's the
      first one to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went back to her room, shivering, and spent the next day in bed with
      an aching head. She rose in the evening, however&mdash;a handbill had been
      slid under her door at five o'clock, calling a &ldquo;Mass Meeting&rdquo; of the
      university at eight, and she felt it her duty to go; but when she got to
      the great hall she found a seat in the dimmest corner, farthest from the
      rostrum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president of the university addressed the tumultuous many hundreds
      before him, for tumultuous they were until he quieted them. He talked to
      them soberly of patriotism, and called upon them for &ldquo;deliberation and a
      little patience.&rdquo; There was danger of a stampede, he said, and he and the
      rest of the faculty were in a measure responsible to their fathers and
      mothers for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must keep your heads,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;God knows, I do not seek to judge
      your duty in this gravest moment of your lives, nor assume to tell you
      what you must or must not do. But by hurrying into service now, without
      careful thought or consideration, you may impair the extent of your
      possible usefulness to the very cause you are so anxious to serve.
      Hundreds of you are taking technical courses which should be completed&mdash;at
      least to the end of the term in June. Instructors from the United States
      Army are already on the way here, and military training will be begun at
      once for all who are physically eligible and of acceptable age. A special
      course will be given in preparation for flying, and those who wish to
      become aviators may enroll themselves for the course at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak to you in a crisis of the university's life, as well as that of
      the nation, and the warning I utter has been made necessary by what took
      place yesterday and to-day. Yesterday morning, a student in the junior
      class enlisted as a private in the United States Regular Army. Far be it
      from me to deplore his course in so doing; he spoke to me about it, and in
      such a way that I felt I had no right to dissuade him. I told him that it
      would be preferable for college men to wait until they could go as
      officers, and, aside from the fact of a greater prestige, I urged that men
      of education could perhaps be more useful in that capacity. He replied
      that if he were useful enough as a private a commission might in time come
      his way, and, as I say, I did not feel at liberty to attempt dissuasion.
      He left to join a regiment to which he had been assigned, and many of you
      were at the station to bid him farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But enthusiasm may be too contagious; even a great and inspiring motive
      may work for harm, and the university must not become a desert. In the
      twenty-four hours since that young man went to join the army last night,
      one hundred and eleven of our young men students have left our walls;
      eighty-four of them went off together at three o'clock to catch an
      east-bound train at the junction and enlist for the Navy at Newport. We
      are, I say, in danger of a stampede.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke on, but Dora was not listening; she had become obsessed by the
      idea which seemed to be carrying her to the border of tragedy. When the
      crowd poured forth from the building she went with it mechanically, and
      paused in the dark outside. She spoke to a girl whom she did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to ask: Do you know who was the student Doctor Corvis spoke of?
      I mean the one that was the first to enlist, and that they were cheering
      last night when he went away to be a private in the United States Army.
      Did you happen to hear his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was a junior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramsey Milholland.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fred Mitchell, crossing the campus one morning, ten days later, saw Dora
      standing near the entrance of her dormitory, where he would pass her
      unless he altered his course; and as he drew nearer her and the details of
      her face grew into distinctness, he was indignant with himself for feeling
      less and less indignation toward her in proportion to the closeness of his
      approach. The pity that came over him was mingled with an unruly
      admiration, causing him to wonder what unpatriotic stuff he could be made
      of. She was marked, but not whipped; she still held herself straight under
      all the hammering and cutting which, to his knowledge, she had been
      getting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped him, &ldquo;for only a moment,&rdquo; she said, adding with a wan
      profoundness: &ldquo;That is, if you're not one of those who feel that I
      shouldn't be 'spoken to'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Fred, stiffly. &ldquo;I may share their point of view, perhaps, but I
      don't feel called upon to obtrude it on you in that manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said, nodding. &ldquo;I've wanted to speak with you about Ramsey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bit her lip, then asked, abruptly: &ldquo;What made him do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enlist as a private with the regulars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What made him enlist at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only because he's that sort,&rdquo; Fred returned briskly. &ldquo;He may be
      inexplicable to people who believe that his going out to fight for his
      country is the same thing as going out to commit a mur&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her hand. &ldquo;Couldn't you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Fred said at once. &ldquo;I'm sorry, but I don't know just
      how to explain him to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, apologetically. &ldquo;Well, you see, as I understand it, you don't
      think it's possible for a person to have something within him that makes
      him care so much about his country that he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don't you think I'm willing to suffer a little rather
      than to see my country in the wrong? Don't you think I'm doing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't want to be rude; but, of course, it seems to me that you're
      suffering because you think you know more about what's right and wrong
      than anybody else does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. But I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wouldn't get anywhere, probably, by arguing it,&rdquo; Fred said. &ldquo;You asked
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you to tell my why he enlisted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble is, I don't think I <i>can</i> tell that to anybody who needs
      an answer. He just went, of course. There isn't any question about it. I
      always thought he'd be the first to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I always thought so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you were mistaken,&rdquo; she said, decidedly. &ldquo;It was a special reason&mdash;to
      make him act so cruelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruelly!&rdquo; Fred cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>was!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cruel to whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, to his mother&mdash;to his family. To have him go off that way,
      without a word&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no' he'd been home,&rdquo; Fred corrected her. &ldquo;He went home the Saturday
      before he enlisted, and settled it with them. They're all broken up, of
      course; but when they saw he'd made up his mind, they quit opposing him,
      and I think they're proud of him about it, maybe, in spite of feeling
      anxious. You see, his father was an artilleryman in the war with Spain,
      and his grandfather was a Colonel at the end of the War of the Rebellion,
      though he went into it as a private, like Ramsey. He died when Ramsey was
      about twelve; but Ramsey remembers him; he was talking of him a little the
      night before he enlisted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora made a gesture of despairing protest. &ldquo;You don't understand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it I don't understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramsey! <i>I</i> know why he went&mdash;and it's just killing me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred looked at her gravely. &ldquo;I don't think you need worry about it,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;There's nothing about his going that you are responsible for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She repeated her despairing gesture. &ldquo;You don't understand. But it's no
      use. It doesn't help any to try to talk of it, though I thought maybe it
      would, somehow.&rdquo; She went a little nearer the dormitory entrance, leaving
      him where he was, then turned. &ldquo;I suppose you won't see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Most probably not till we meet-if we should&mdash;in
      France. I don't know where he's stationed; and I'm going with the aviation&mdash;if
      it's ever ready! And he's with the regulars; he'll probably be among the
      first to go over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; She turned sharply away, calling back over her shoulder in a
      choked voice. &ldquo;Thank you. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Fred's heart had melted; gazing after her, he saw that her proud young
      head had lowered now, and that her shoulders were moving convulsively; he
      ran after her and caught her as she began slowly to ascend the dormitory
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Don't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted a wet face. &ldquo;No, no! He went in bitterness because I told him
      to, in my own bitterness! I've killed him! Long ago, when he wasn't much
      more than a child, I heard he'd said that some day he'd 'show' me, and now
      he's done it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fred whistled low and long when she had disappeared. &ldquo;Girls!&rdquo; he murmured
      to himself. &ldquo;Some girls, anyhow&mdash;they will be girls! You can't tell
      'em what's what, and you can't change 'em, either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as more urgent matters again occupied his attention, he went on at
      an ardent and lively gait to attend his class in map-making.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      That thunder in the soil, at first too deep within it to be audible, had
      come to the surface now and gradually became heard as the thunder of a
      million feet upon the training grounds. The bugles rang sharper; the drums
      and fifes of town and village and countryside were the drums and fifes of
      a war that came closer and closer to every hearth between the two oceans.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the old symbols became symbols bright and new, as if no one had ever
      seen them before. &ldquo;America&rdquo; was like a new word, and the song &ldquo;America&rdquo;
       was like a new song. All the dusty blatancies of orating candidates,
      seeking to rouse bored auditors with &ldquo;the old flag&rdquo;; all the mechanical
      patriotics of school and church and club; all these time-worn flaccid
      things leaped suddenly into living colour. The flag became brilliant and
      strange to see&mdash;strange with a meaning that seemed new, a meaning
      long known, yet never known till now.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so hearts that thought they knew themselves came upon ambushes of
      emotion and hidden indwellings of spirit not guessed before. Dora Yocum,
      listening to the &ldquo;Star Spangled Banner,&rdquo; sung by children of immigrants to
      an out-of-tune old piano in a mission clubroom, in Chicago, found herself
      crying with a soul-shaking heartiness in a way different from other ways
      that she had cried. Among the many things she thought of then was this:
      That the banner the children were singing about was in danger. The great
      country, almost a continent, had always seemed so untouchable, so safe and
      sure; she had never been able to conceive of a hostile power mighty enough
      to shake or even jar it. And since so great and fundamental a thing could
      not be injured, a war for its defence had appeared to be, in her eyes, not
      only wicked but ridiculous. At last, less and less vaguely, she had come
      to comprehend something of the colossal German threat, and the shadow that
      touched this bright banner of which the immigrants' children piped so
      briskly in the mission club-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had begun to understand, though she could not have told just why, or
      how, or at what moment understanding reached her. She began to understand
      that her country, threatened to the life, had flung its line those
      thousands of miles across the sea to stand and hold Hindenburg and
      Ludendorff and all their Kaisers, Kings, Dukes, and Crown Princes, their
      Krupp and Skoda monstrous engines, and their monstrous other engines of
      men made into armies. Through the long haze of misted sea-miles and the
      smoke of land-miles she perceived that brown line of ours, and knew it
      stood there that Freedom, and the Nation itself, might not perish from the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, a week later, she went home, and came nervously to Ramsey's mother
      and found how to direct the letter she wanted to write. He was in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the old phrase went, she poured out her heart. It seems to apply to her
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't misunderstand me. I felt that my bitter speech to you had driven you
      to take the step you did. I felt that I had sent you to be killed, and
      that I ought to be killed for doing it, but I knew that you had other
      motives, too. I knew, of course, that you thought of the country more than
      you did of me, or of any mad thing I would say&mdash;but I thought that
      what I said might have been the prompting thing, the word that threw you
      into it so hastily and before you were ready, perhaps. I dreaded to bear
      that terrible responsibility. I hope you understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      My great mistake has been&mdash;I thought I sas so &ldquo;logical&rdquo;&mdash;it's
      been in my starting everything with a thought I'd never proven; that war
      is the worst thing, and all other evils were lesser. I was wrong. I was
      wrong, because war isn't the worst evil. Slavery is the worse evil, and
      now I want to tell you I have come to see that you are making war on those
      that make slavery. Yes, you are fighting those that make both war and
      slavery, and you are right, and I humbly reverence and honour all of you
      who are in this right war. I have come home to work in the Red Cross here;
      I work there all day, and all day I keep saying to myself&mdash;but I
      really mean to <i>you</i>&mdash;it's what I pray, and oh, how I pray it:
      &ldquo;God be with you and grant you the victory!&rdquo; For you must win and you will
      win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgive me, oh, please&mdash;and if you will, could you write to me? I
      know you have things to do more important than &ldquo;girls&rdquo;&mdash;but oh,
      couldn't you, please?
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter, which she had taken care not to dampen, as she wrote, went in
      slow course to the &ldquo;American Expeditionary Forces in France,&rdquo; and finally
      found him whom it patiently sought. He delayed not long to answer, and in
      time she held in a shaking hand the pencilled missive he had sent her.
    </p>
    <p>
      You forget all that comic talk about me enlisting because of your telling
      me to. I'd written my father I was going at the first chance a month and a
      half before that day when you said it. My mind was made up at the first
      time there was any talk of war, and you had about as much responsibility
      for my going as some little sparrow or something. Of course I don't mean I
      didn't pay any attention to the different things you said, because I
      always did, and I used to worry over it because I was afraid some day it
      would get you in trouble, and I'm mighty glad you've cut it out. That's
      right; you be a regular girl now. You always were one, and I knew it all
      right. I'm not as scared to write to you as I was to talk to you, so I
      guess you know I was mighty tickled to get your letter. It sounded blue,
      but I was glad to get it. You <i>bet</i> I'll write to you! I don't
      suppose you could have any idea how glad I was to get your letter. I could
      sit here and write to you all day if they'd let me, but I'm a corporal
      now. When you answer this, I wish you'd say how the old town looks and if
      the grass in the front yards is as green as it usually is, and everything.
      And tell me some more about everything you think of when you are working
      down at the Red Cross like you said. I guess I've read your letter five
      million times, and that part ten million. I mean where you underlined that
      &ldquo;<i>you</i>&rdquo; and what you said to yourself at the Red Cross. Oh, murder,
      but I was glad to read that! Don't forget about writing anything else you
      think of like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I was interrupted then and this is the next day. Of course, I can't
      tell you where we are, because that darned censor will read this letter,
      but I guess he will let this much by. Who do you think I ran across in a
      village yesterday? Two boys from the old school days, and we certainly did
      shake hands a few times! It was the old foolish Dutch Krusemeyer and
      Albert Paxton, both of them lieutenants. I heard Fred Mitchell is still
      training in the States and about crazy because they won't send him over
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you had any idea how glad I was to get your letter, you wouldn't lose
      any time answering this one. Anyhow, I'm going to write to you again every
      few days if I get the chance, because maybe you'll answer more than one of
      'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      But see here, cut out that &ldquo;sent you to be killed&rdquo; stuff. You've got the
      wrong idea altogether. We've got the big job of our lives, we know that,
      but we're going to do it. There'll be mistakes and bad times, but we won't
      fall down. Now you'll excuse me for saying it this way, Dora, but I don't
      know just how to express myself except saying of course we know everybody
      isn't going to get back home&mdash;but listen, we didn't come over here to
      get killed particularly, we came over here to give these Dutchmen h&mdash;l!
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps you can excuse language if I write it with a blank like that, but
      before we get back we're going to do what we came for. They may not all of
      them be as bad as some of them&mdash;it's a good thing you don't know what
      we do, because some of it would make you sick. As I say, there may be
      quite a lot of good ones among them; but we know what they've done to this
      country, and we know what they mean to do to ours. So we're going to
      attend to them. Of course that's why I'm here. It wasn't you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't forget to write pretty soon, Dora. You say in your letter&mdash;I
      certainly was glad to get that letter&mdash;well, you say I have things to
      do more important than &ldquo;girls.&rdquo; Dora, I think you probably know without my
      saying so that of course while I have got important things to do, just as
      every man over here has, and everybody at home, for that matter, well, the
      thing that is most important in the world to me, next to helping win this
      war, it's reading the next letter from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't forget how glad I'll be to get it, and don't forget you didn't have
      anything to do with my being over here. That was&mdash;it was something
      else. And you bet, whatever happens I'm glad I came! Don't ever forget <i>that</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora knew it was &ldquo;something else.&rdquo; Her memory went back to her first
      recollection of him in school: from that time on he had been just an
      ordinary, everyday boy, floundering somehow through his lessons in school
      and through his sweethearting with Milla, as the millions of other boys
      floundered along with their own lessons and their own Millas. She saw him
      swinging his books and romping homeward from the schoolhouse, or going
      whistling by her father's front yard, rattling a stick on the fence as he
      went, care-free and masterful, but shy as a deer if strangers looked at
      him, and always &ldquo;not much of a talker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had always felt so superior to him, she shuddered as she thought of
      it. His quiet had been so much better than her talk. His intelligence was
      proven now, when it came to the great test, to be of a stronger sort than
      hers. He was wise and good and gentle&mdash;and a fighting man! &ldquo;We know
      what they've done to this country and what they mean to do to ours. So
      we're going to attend to them.&rdquo; She read this over, and she knew that
      Ramsey, wise and gentle and good, would fight like an unchained devil, and
      that he and his comrades would indeed and indeed do what they &ldquo;came for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't you,&rdquo; he said. She nodded gently, agreeing, and knew what it
      was that sent him. Yet Ramsey had his own secret there, and did not tell
      it. Sometimes there rose, faint in his memory, a whimsical picture, yet
      one that had always meant much to him. He would see an old man sitting
      with a little boy upon a rustic bench under a walnut tree to watch the
      &ldquo;Decoration Day Parade&rdquo; go by&mdash;and Ramsey would see a shoot of
      sunshine that had somehow got through the walnut tree and made a
      bedazzlement of glinting fine lines over a spot about the size of a
      saucer, upon the old man's thick white hair. And in Ramsey's memory, the
      little boy, sitting beside the veteran, would half close his eyes,
      drowsily, playing that this sunshine spot was a white bird's-nest, until
      he had a momentary dream of a glittering little bird that dwelt there and
      wore a blue soldier cap on its head. And Ramsey would bring out of his
      memory thoughts that the old man had got into the child's head that day.
      &ldquo;We knew that armies fighting for the Freedom of Man <i>had</i> to win, in
      the long run.... We were on the side of God's Plan.... Long ago we began
      to see hints of His Plan.... Man has to win his freedom from himself&mdash;men
      in the light have to fight against men in the dark.... That light is the
      answer.... We had the light that made us never doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long while Dora sat with the letter in her hand before she answered it
      and took it upon her heart to wear. That was the place for it, since it
      was already within her heart, where he would find it when he came home
      again. And she beheld the revelation sent to her. This ordinary life of
      Ramsey's was but the outward glinting of a high and splendid spirit, as
      high and splendid as earth can show. And yet it was only the life of an
      everyday American boy. The streets of the town were full, now, of boys
      like Ramsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first they were just boys in uniform; then one saw that they were boys
      no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were soldiers.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
